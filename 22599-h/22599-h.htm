<h3>PREFACE</h3>

  <p>So familiar are we with the numerals that bear the misleading name of
  Arabic, and so extensive is their use in Europe and the Americas, that it
  is difficult for us to realize that their general acceptance in the
  transactions of commerce is a matter of only the last four centuries, and
  that they are unknown to a very large part of the human race to-day. It
  seems strange that such a labor-saving device should have struggled for
  nearly a thousand years after its system of place value was perfected
  before it replaced such crude notations as the one that the Roman
  conqueror made substantially universal in Europe. Such, however, is the
  case, and there is probably no one who has not at least some slight
  passing interest in the story of this struggle. To the mathematician and
  the student of civilization the interest is generally a deep one; to the
  teacher of the elements of knowledge the interest may be less marked, but
  nevertheless it is real; and even the business man who makes daily use of
  the curious symbols by which we express the numbers of commerce, cannot
  fail to have some appreciation for the story of the rise and progress of
  these tools of his trade.</p>

  <p>This story has often been told in part, but it is a long time since
  any effort has been made to bring together the fragmentary narrations and
  to set forth the general problem of the origin and development of these
  <!-- Page iv --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pageiv"></a>[iv]</span>numerals. In this little work we have
  attempted to state the history of these forms in small compass, to place
  before the student materials for the investigation of the problems
  involved, and to express as clearly as possible the results of the labors
  of scholars who have studied the subject in different parts of the world.
  We have had no theory to exploit, for the history of mathematics has seen
  too much of this tendency already, but as far as possible we have weighed
  the testimony and have set forth what seem to be the reasonable
  conclusions from the evidence at hand.</p>

  <p>To facilitate the work of students an index has been prepared which we
  hope may be serviceable. In this the names of authors appear only when
  some use has been made of their opinions or when their works are first
  mentioned in full in a footnote.</p>

  <p>If this work shall show more clearly the value of our number system,
  and shall make the study of mathematics seem more real to the teacher and
  student, and shall offer material for interesting some pupil more fully
  in his work with numbers, the authors will feel that the considerable
  labor involved in its preparation has not been in vain.</p>

  <p>We desire to acknowledge our especial indebtedness to Professor
  Alexander Ziwet for reading all the proof, as well as for the digest of a
  Russian work, to Professor Clarence L. Meader for Sanskrit
  transliterations, and to Mr. Steven T. Byington for Arabic
  transliterations and the scheme of pronunciation of Oriental names, and
  also our indebtedness to other scholars in Oriental learning for
  information.</p>

<h3>PRONUNCIATION OF ORIENTAL NAMES</h3>

  <p>(S) = in Sanskrit names and words; (A) = in Arabic names and
  words.</p>

  <p><b>b</b>, <b>d</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>g</b>, <b>h</b>, <b>j</b>, <b>l</b>,
  <b>m</b>, <b>n</b>, <b>p</b>, <b>sh</b> (A), <b>t</b>, <b>th</b> (A),
  <b>v</b>, <b>w</b>, <b>x</b>, <b>z</b>, as in English.</p>

  <p><b>a</b>, (S) like <i>u</i> in <i>but</i>: thus <i>pandit</i>,
  pronounced <i>pundit</i>. (A) like <i>a</i> in <i>ask</i> or in
  <i>man</i>. <b>&#x101;</b>, as in <i>father</i>.</p>

  <p><b>c</b>, (S) like <i>ch</i> in <i>church</i> (Italian <i>c</i> in
  <i>cento</i>).</p>

  <p><b><span class="special" title="d-dot-below">&#x1E0D;</span></b>,
  <b><span class="special" title="n-dot-below">&#x1E47;</span></b>,
  <b><span class="special" title="s-dot-below">&#x1E63;</span></b>,
  <b><span class="special" title="t-dot-below">&#x1E6D;</span></b>, (S)
  <i>d</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>sh</i>, <i>t</i>, made with the tip of the tongue
  turned up and back into the dome of the palate. <b><span class="special"
  title="d-dot-below">&#x1E0D;</span></b>, <b><span class="special"
  title="s-dot-below">&#x1E63;</span></b>, <b><span class="special"
  title="t-dot-below">&#x1E6D;</span></b>, <b><span class="special"
  title="z-dot-below">&#x1E93;</span></b>, (A) <i>d</i>, <i>s</i>,
  <i>t</i>, <i>z</i>, made with the tongue spread so that the sounds are
  produced largely against the side teeth. Europeans commonly pronounce
  <b><span class="special" title="d-dot-below">&#x1E0D;</span></b>,
  <b><span class="special" title="n-dot-below">&#x1E47;</span></b>,
  <b><span class="special" title="s-dot-below">&#x1E63;</span></b>,
  <b><span class="special" title="t-dot-below">&#x1E6D;</span></b>,
  <b><span class="special" title="z-dot-below">&#x1E93;</span></b>, both
  (S) and (A), as simple <i>d</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>sh</i> (S) or <i>s</i> (A),
  <i>t</i>, <i>z</i>. <b><span class="special"
  title="d-line-below">&#x1E0F;</span></b> (A), like <i>th</i> in
  <i>this</i>.</p>

  <p><b>e</b>, (S) as in <i>they</i>. (A) as in <i>bed</i>.</p>

  <p><b>&#x121;</b>, (A) a voiced consonant formed below the vocal cords;
  its sound is compared by some to a <i>g</i>, by others to a guttural
  <i>r</i>; in Arabic words adopted into English it is represented by
  <i>gh</i> (e.g. <i>ghoul</i>), less often <i>r</i> (e.g.
  <i>razzia</i>).</p>

  <p><b>h</b> preceded by <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>t</i>, <i><span
  class="special" title="t-dot-below">&#x1E6D;</span></i>, etc. does not
  form a single sound with these letters, but is a more or less distinct
  <i>h</i> sound following them; cf. the sounds in <i>abhor, boathook</i>,
  etc., or, more accurately for (S), the "bhoys" etc. of Irish brogue.
  <b>h</b> (A) retains its consonant sound at the end of a word. <b><span
  class="special" title="h-dot-below">&#x1E25;</span></b>, (A) an unvoiced
  consonant formed below the vocal cords; its sound is sometimes compared
  to German hard <i>ch</i>, and may be represented by an <i>h</i> as strong
  as possible. In Arabic words adopted into English it is represented by
  <i>h</i>, e.g. in <i>sahib</i>, <i>hakeem</i>. <b><span class="special"
  title="h-dot-below">&#x1E25;</span></b> (S) is final consonant <i>h</i>,
  like final <i>h</i> (A).</p>

  <p><b>i</b>, as in <i>pin</i>. <b>&#x12B;</b>, as in <i>pique</i>.</p>

  <p><b>k</b>, as in <i>kick</i>.</p>

  <p><b>kh</b>, (A) the hard <i>ch</i> of Scotch <i>loch</i>, German
  <i>ach</i>, especially of German as pronounced by the Swiss.</p>

  <p><b><span class="special" title="m-dot-above">&#x1E41;</span></b>,
  <b><span class="special" title="n-dot-above">&#x1E45;</span></b>, (S)
  like French final <i>m</i> or <i>n</i>, nasalizing the preceding
  vowel.</p>

  <p><b><span class="special" title="n-dot-below">&#x1E47;</span></b>, see
  <b><span class="special" title="d-dot-below">&#x1E0D;</span></b>.
  <b>ñ</b>, like <i>ng</i> in <i>singing</i>.</p>

  <p><b>o</b>, (S) as in <i>so</i>. (A) as in <i>obey</i>.</p>

  <p><b>q</b>, (A) like <i>k</i> (or <i>c</i>) in <i>cook</i>; further back
  in the mouth than in <i>kick</i>.</p>

  <p><b>r</b>, (S) English <i>r</i>, smooth and untrilled. (A) stronger.
  <b><span class="special" title="r-dot-below">&#x1E5B;</span></b>, (S) r
  used as vowel, as in <i>apron</i> when pronounced <i>aprn</i> and not
  <i>apern</i>; modern Hindus say <i>ri</i>, hence our <i>amrita</i>,
  <i>Krishna</i>, for <i><span class="special"
  title="a-mrta">a-m&#x1E5B;ta</span>, <span class="special"
  title="Krsna">K&#x1E5B;&#x1E63;&#x1E47;a</span></i>.</p>

  <p><b>s</b>, as in <i>same</i>. <b><span class="special"
  title="s-dot-below">&#x1E63;</span></b>, see <b><span class="special"
  title="d-dot-below">&#x1E0D;</span></b>. <b>&#x15B;</b>, (S) English
  <i>sh</i> (German <i>sch</i>).</p>

  <p><b><span class="special" title="t-dot-below">&#x1E6D;</span></b>, see
  <b><span class="special" title="d-dot-below">&#x1E0D;</span></b>.</p>

  <p><b>u</b>, as in <i>put</i>. <b>&#x16B;</b>, as in <i>rule</i>.</p>

  <p><b>y</b>, as in <i>you</i>.</p>

  <p><b><span class="special" title="z-dot-below">&#x1E93;</span></b>, see
  <b><span class="special" title="d-dot-below">&#x1E0D;</span></b>.</p>

  <p><b>&#x201B;</b>, (A) a sound kindred to the spiritus lenis (that is,
  to our ears, the mere distinct separation of a vowel from the preceding
  sound, as at the beginning of a word in German) and to <i><span
  class="special" title="h-dot-below">&#x1E25;</span></i>. The &#x201B; is
  a very distinct sound in Arabic, but is more nearly represented by the
  spiritus lenis than by any sound that we can produce without much special
  training. That is, it should be treated as silent, but the sounds that

  <i>Caaba</i> (<i>&#x201B;Arab</i>, <i>&#x201B;anbar</i>,
  <i>ka&#x201B;abah</i>).</p>

  <p>(A) A final long vowel is shortened before <i>al</i> (<i>'l</i>) or

  consonants, but <i>h</i> after another consonant does not. (A), on the
  last syllable that contains a long vowel or a vowel followed by two
  consonants, except that a final long vowel is not ordinarily accented; if
  there is no long vowel nor two consecutive consonants, the accent falls
  on the first syllable. The words <i>al</i> and <i>ibn</i> are never
  accented.</p>

<h2>THE HINDU-ARABIC NUMERALS</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<p class="cenhead">EARLY IDEAS OF THEIR ORIGIN</p>

  <p>It has long been recognized that the common numerals used in daily
  life are of comparatively recent origin. The number of systems of
  notation employed before the Christian era was about the same as the
  number of written languages, and in some cases a single language had
  several systems. The Egyptians, for example, had three systems of
  writing, with a numerical notation for each; the Greeks had two
  well-defined sets of numerals, and the Roman symbols for number changed
  more or less from century to century. Even to-day the number of methods
  of expressing numerical concepts is much greater than one would believe
  before making a study of the subject, for the idea that our common
  numerals are universal is far from being correct. It will be well, then,
  to think of the numerals that we still commonly call Arabic, as only one
  of many systems in use just before the Christian era. As it then existed
  the system was no better than many others, it was of late origin, it
  contained no zero, it was cumbersome and little used, <!-- Page 2
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page2"></a>[2]</span>and it had no
  particular promise. Not until centuries later did the system have any
  standing in the world of business and science; and had the place value
  which now characterizes it, and which requires a zero, been worked out in
  Greece, we might have been using Greek numerals to-day instead of the
  ones with which we are familiar.</p>

  <p>Of the first number forms that the world used this is not the place to
  speak. Many of them are interesting, but none had much scientific value.
  In Europe the invention of notation was generally assigned to the eastern
  shores of the Mediterranean until the critical period of about a century
  ago,&mdash;sometimes to the Hebrews, sometimes to the Egyptians, but more
  often to the early trading Ph&oelig;nicians.<a name="NtA_1"
  href="#Nt_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The idea that our common numerals are Arabic in origin is not an old
  one. The mediæval and Renaissance writers generally recognized them as
  Indian, and many of them expressly stated that they were of Hindu
  origin.<a name="NtA_2" href="#Nt_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> <!-- Page 3
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page3"></a>[3]</span>Others argued that
  they were probably invented by the Chaldeans or the Jews because they
  increased in value from right to left, an argument that would apply quite
  as well to the Roman and Greek systems, or to any other. It was, indeed,
  to the general idea of notation that many of these writers referred, as
  is evident from the words of England's earliest arithmetical
  textbook-maker, Robert Recorde (c. 1542): "In that thinge all men do
  agree, that the Chaldays, whiche fyrste inuented thys arte, did set these
  figures as thei set all their letters. for they wryte backwarde as you
  tearme it, and so doo they reade. And that may appeare in all Hebrewe,
  Chaldaye and Arabike bookes ... where as the Greekes, Latines, and all
  nations of Europe, do wryte and reade from the lefte hand towarde the
  ryghte."<a name="NtA_3" href="#Nt_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> Others, and <!--
  Page 4 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page4"></a>[4]</span>among them
  such influential writers as Tartaglia<a name="NtA_4"
  href="#Nt_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> in Italy and Köbel<a name="NtA_5"
  href="#Nt_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> in Germany, asserted the Arabic origin of
  the numerals, while still others left the matter undecided<a name="NtA_6"
  href="#Nt_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> or simply dismissed them as "barbaric."<a
  name="NtA_7" href="#Nt_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> Of course the Arabs
  themselves never laid claim to the invention, always recognizing their
  indebtedness to the Hindus both for the numeral forms and for the
  distinguishing feature of place value. Foremost among these writers was
  the great master of the golden age of Bagdad, one of the first of the
  Arab writers to collect the mathematical classics of both the East and
  the West, preserving them and finally passing them on to awakening
  Europe. This man was <span class="special"
  title="Mohammed">Mo&#x1E25;ammed</span> the Son of Moses, from
  Khow&#x101;rezm, or, more after the manner of the Arab, <span
  class="special" title="Mohammed">Mo&#x1E25;ammed</span> ibn
  M&#x16B;s&#x101; al-Khow&#x101;razm&#x12B;,<a name="NtA_8"
  href="#Nt_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> a man of great <!-- Page 5 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page5"></a>[5]</span>learning and one to whom
  the world is much indebted for its present knowledge of algebra<a
  name="NtA_9" href="#Nt_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> and of arithmetic. Of him
  there will often be occasion to speak; and in the arithmetic which he
  wrote, and of which Adelhard of Bath<a name="NtA_10"
  href="#Nt_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> (c. 1130) may have made the translation
  or paraphrase,<a name="NtA_11" href="#Nt_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> he
  stated distinctly that the numerals were due to the Hindus.<a
  name="NtA_12" href="#Nt_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> This is as plainly
  asserted by later Arab <!-- Page 6 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page6"></a>[6]</span>writers, even to the present day.<a
  name="NtA_13" href="#Nt_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> Indeed the phrase
  <i>&#x201B;ilm hind&#x12B;</i>, "Indian science," is used by them for
  arithmetic, as also the adjective <i>hind&#x12B;</i> alone.<a
  name="NtA_14" href="#Nt_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Probably the most striking testimony from Arabic sources is that given
  by the Arabic traveler and scholar <span class="special" title="Mohammed ibn Ahmed"
  >Mohammed ibn A&#x1E25;med</span>, <span class="special" title="Abu 'l-Rihan al-Biruni"
  >Ab&#x16B; 'l-R&#x12B;&#x1E25;&#x101;n al-B&#x12B;r&#x16B;n&#x12B;</span>
  (973-1048), who spent many years in Hindustan. He wrote a large work on
  India,<a name="NtA_15" href="#Nt_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> one on ancient
  chronology,<a name="NtA_16" href="#Nt_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> the "Book
  of the Ciphers," unfortunately lost, which treated doubtless of the Hindu
  art of calculating, and was the author of numerous other works.
  Al-B&#x12B;r&#x16B;n&#x12B; was a man of unusual attainments, being
  versed in Arabic, Persian, Sanskrit, Hebrew, and Syriac, as well as in
  astronomy, chronology, and mathematics. In his work on India he gives
  detailed information concerning the language and <!-- Page 7 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page7"></a>[7]</span>customs of the people of
  that country, and states explicitly<a name="NtA_17"
  href="#Nt_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> that the Hindus of his time did not use
  the letters of their alphabet for numerical notation, as the Arabs did.
  He also states that the numeral signs called <i><span class="special"
  title="anka">a&#x1E45;ka</span></i><a name="NtA_18"
  href="#Nt_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> had different shapes in various parts
  of India, as was the case with the letters. In his <i>Chronology of
  Ancient Nations</i> he gives the sum of a geometric progression and shows
  how, in order to avoid any possibility of error, the number may be
  expressed in three different systems: with Indian symbols, in sexagesimal
  notation, and by an alphabet system which will be touched upon later. He
  also speaks<a name="NtA_19" href="#Nt_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> of "179,
  876, 755, expressed in Indian ciphers," thus again attributing these
  forms to Hindu sources.</p>

  <p>Preceding Al-B&#x12B;r&#x16B;n&#x12B; there was another Arabic writer
  of the tenth century, <span class="special" title="Motahhar ibn Tahir"
  >Mo&#x1E6D;ahhar ibn &#x1E6C;&#x101;hir</span>,<a name="NtA_20"
  href="#Nt_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> author of the <i>Book of the Creation
  and of History</i>, who gave as a curiosity, in Indian
  (N&#x101;gar&#x12B;) symbols, a large number asserted by the people of
  India to represent the duration of the world. Huart feels positive that
  in <span class="special" title="Motahhar's">Mo&#x1E6D;ahhar's</span> time
  the present Arabic symbols had not yet come into use, and that the Indian
  symbols, although known to scholars, were not current. Unless this were
  the case, neither the author nor his readers would have found anything
  extraordinary in the appearance of the number which he cites.</p>

  <p>Mention should also be made of a widely-traveled student,
  Al-Mas&#x201B;&#x16B;d&#x12B; (885?-956), whose journeys carried him from
  Bagdad to Persia, India, Ceylon, and even <!-- Page 8 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page8"></a>[8]</span>across the China sea, and
  at other times to Madagascar, Syria, and Palestine.<a name="NtA_21"
  href="#Nt_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> He seems to have neglected no
  accessible sources of information, examining also the history of the
  Persians, the Hindus, and the Romans. Touching the period of the Caliphs
  his work entitled <i>Meadows of Gold</i> furnishes a most entertaining
  fund of information. He states<a name="NtA_22"
  href="#Nt_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> that the wise men of India, assembled
  by the king, composed the <i>Sindhind</i>. Further on<a name="NtA_23"
  href="#Nt_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> he states, upon the authority of the
  historian <span class="special" title="Mohammed">Mo&#x1E25;ammed</span>
  ibn &#x201B;Al&#x12B; &#x201B;Abd&#x12B;, that by order of <span
  class="special" title="Al-Mansur">Al-Man&#x1E63;&#x16B;r</span> many
  works of science and astrology were translated into Arabic, notably the
  <i>Sindhind</i> (<i>Siddh&#x101;nta</i>). Concerning the meaning and
  spelling of this name there is considerable diversity of opinion.
  Colebrooke<a name="NtA_24" href="#Nt_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> first
  pointed out the connection between <i>Siddh&#x101;nta</i> and
  <i>Sindhind</i>. He ascribes to the word the meaning "the revolving
  ages."<a name="NtA_25" href="#Nt_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> Similar
  designations are collected by Sédillot,<a name="NtA_26"
  href="#Nt_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> who inclined to the Greek origin of the
  sciences commonly attributed to the Hindus.<a name="NtA_27"
  href="#Nt_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a> Casiri,<a name="NtA_28"
  href="#Nt_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a> citing the <i><span class="special"
  title="Tarikh al-hokama">T&#x101;r&#x12B;kh
  al-&#x1E25;okam&#x101;</span></i> or <i>Chronicles of the Learned</i>,<a
  name="NtA_29" href="#Nt_29"><sup>[29]</sup></a> refers to the work <!--
  Page 9 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page9"></a>[9]</span>as the
  <i>Sindum-Indum</i> with the meaning "perpetuum æternumque." The
  reference<a name="NtA_30" href="#Nt_30"><sup>[30]</sup></a> in this
  ancient Arabic work to Al-Khow&#x101;razm&#x12B; is worthy of note.</p>

  <p>This <i>Sindhind</i> is the book, says Mas&#x201B;&#x16B;d&#x12B;,<a
  name="NtA_31" href="#Nt_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> which gives all that the
  Hindus know of the spheres, the stars, arithmetic,<a name="NtA_32"
  href="#Nt_32"><sup>[32]</sup></a> and the other branches of science. He
  mentions also Al-Khow&#x101;razm&#x12B; and <span class="special"
  title="Habash">&#x1E24;abash</span><a name="NtA_33"
  href="#Nt_33"><sup>[33]</sup></a> as translators of the tables of the
  <i>Sindhind</i>. Al-B&#x12B;r&#x16B;n&#x12B;<a name="NtA_34"
  href="#Nt_34"><sup>[34]</sup></a> refers to two other translations from a
  work furnished by a Hindu who came to Bagdad as a member of the political
  mission which Sindh sent to the caliph <span class="special"
  title="Al-Mansur">Al-Man&#x1E63;&#x16B;r</span>, in the year of the
  Hejira 154 (<span class="scac">A.D.</span> 771).</p>

  <p>The oldest work, in any sense complete, on the history of Arabic
  literature and history is the <i>Kit&#x101;b al-Fihrist</i>, written in
  the year 987 <span class="scac">A.D.</span>, by Ibn Ab&#x12B;
  Ya&#x201B;q&#x16B;b al-Nad&#x12B;m. It is of fundamental importance for
  the history of Arabic culture. Of the ten chief divisions of the work,
  the seventh demands attention in this discussion for the reason that its
  second subdivision treats of mathematicians and astronomers.<a
  name="NtA_35" href="#Nt_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 10 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page10"></a>[10]</span></p>

  <p>The first of the Arabic writers mentioned is Al-Kind&#x12B; (800-870
  <span class="scac">A.D.</span>), who wrote five books on arithmetic and
  four books on the use of the Indian method of reckoning. Sened ibn
  &#x201B;Al&#x12B;, the Jew, who was converted to Islam under the caliph
  Al-M&#x101;m&#x16B;n, is also given as the author of a work on the Hindu
  method of reckoning. Nevertheless, there is a possibility<a name="NtA_36"
  href="#Nt_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a> that some of the works ascribed to
  Sened ibn &#x201B;Al&#x12B; are really works of
  Al-Khow&#x101;razm&#x12B;, whose name immediately precedes his. However,
  it is to be noted in this connection that Casiri<a name="NtA_37"
  href="#Nt_37"><sup>[37]</sup></a> also mentions the same writer as the
  author of a most celebrated work on arithmetic.</p>

  <p>To <span class="special"
  title="Al-Sufi">Al-&#x1E62;&#x16B;f&#x12B;</span>, who died in 986 <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span>, is also credited a large work on the same
  subject, and similar treatises by other writers are mentioned. We are
  therefore forced to the conclusion that the Arabs from the early ninth
  century on fully recognized the Hindu origin of the new numerals.</p>

  <p>Leonard of Pisa, of whom we shall speak at length in the chapter on
  the Introduction of the Numerals into Europe, wrote his <i>Liber
  Abbaci</i><a name="NtA_38" href="#Nt_38"><sup>[38]</sup></a> in 1202. In
  this work he refers frequently to the nine Indian figures,<a
  name="NtA_39" href="#Nt_39"><sup>[39]</sup></a> thus showing again the
  general consensus of opinion in the Middle Ages that the numerals were of
  Hindu origin.</p>

  <p>Some interest also attaches to the oldest documents on arithmetic in
  our own language. One of the earliest <!-- Page 11 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page11"></a>[11]</span>treatises on algorism is
  a commentary<a name="NtA_40" href="#Nt_40"><sup>[40]</sup></a> on a set
  of verses called the <i>Carmen de Algorismo</i>, written by Alexander de
  Villa Dei (Alexandra de Ville-Dieu), a Minorite monk of about 1240 <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> The text of the first few lines is as
  follows:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<p class="cenhead">EARLY HINDU FORMS WITH NO PLACE VALUE</p>

  <p>While it is generally conceded that the scientific development of
  astronomy among the Hindus towards the beginning of the Christian era
  rested upon Greek<a name="NtA_42" href="#Nt_42"><sup>[42]</sup></a> or
  Chinese<a name="NtA_43" href="#Nt_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a> sources, yet
  their ancient literature testifies to a high state of civilization, and
  to a considerable advance in sciences, in philosophy, and along literary
  lines, long before the golden age of Greece. From the earliest times even
  up to the present day the Hindu has been wont to put his thought into
  rhythmic form. The first of this poetry&mdash;it well deserves this name,
  being also worthy from a metaphysical point of view<a name="NtA_44"
  href="#Nt_44"><sup>[44]</sup></a>&mdash;consists of the Vedas, hymns of
  praise and poems of worship, collected during the Vedic period which
  dates from approximately 2000 <span class="scac">B.C.</span> to 1400
  <span class="scac">B.C.</span><a name="NtA_45"
  href="#Nt_45"><sup>[45]</sup></a> Following this work, or possibly
  contemporary with it, is the Brahmanic literature, which is partly
  ritualistic (the <span class="special"
  title="Brahmanas">Br&#x101;hma&#x1E47;as</span>), and partly
  philosophical (the Upanishads). Our especial interest is <!-- Page 13
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page13"></a>[13]</span>in the
  S&#x16B;tras, versified abridgments of the ritual and of ceremonial
  rules, which contain considerable geometric material used in connection
  with altar construction, and also numerous examples of rational numbers
  the sum of whose squares is also a square, i.e. "Pythagorean numbers,"
  although this was long before Pythagoras lived. Whitney<a name="NtA_46"
  href="#Nt_46"><sup>[46]</sup></a> places the whole of the Veda
  literature, including the Vedas, the <span class="special"
  title="Brahmanas">Br&#x101;hma&#x1E47;as</span>, and the S&#x16B;tras,
  between 1500 <span class="scac">B.C.</span> and 800 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>, thus agreeing with Bürk<a name="NtA_47"
  href="#Nt_47"><sup>[47]</sup></a> who holds that the knowledge of the
  Pythagorean theorem revealed in the S&#x16B;tras goes back to the eighth
  century <span class="scac">B.C.</span></p>

  <p>The importance of the S&#x16B;tras as showing an independent origin of
  Hindu geometry, contrary to the opinion long held by Cantor<a
  name="NtA_48" href="#Nt_48"><sup>[48]</sup></a> of a Greek origin, has
  been repeatedly emphasized in recent literature,<a name="NtA_49"
  href="#Nt_49"><sup>[49]</sup></a> especially since the appearance of the
  important work of Von Schroeder.<a name="NtA_50"
  href="#Nt_50"><sup>[50]</sup></a> Further fundamental mathematical
  notions such as the conception of irrationals and the use of gnomons, as
  well as the philosophical doctrine of the transmigration of
  souls,&mdash;all of these having long been attributed to the
  Greeks,&mdash;are shown in these works to be native to India. Although
  this discussion does not bear directly upon the <!-- Page 14 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page14"></a>[14]</span>origin of our numerals,
  yet it is highly pertinent as showing the aptitude of the Hindu for
  mathematical and mental work, a fact further attested by the independent
  development of the drama and of epic and lyric poetry.</p>

  <p>It should be stated definitely at the outset, however, that we are not
  at all sure that the most ancient forms of the numerals commonly known as
  Arabic had their origin in India. As will presently be seen, their forms
  may have been suggested by those used in Egypt, or in Eastern Persia, or
  in China, or on the plains of Mesopotamia. We are quite in the dark as to
  these early steps; but as to their development in India, the approximate
  period of the rise of their essential feature of place value, their
  introduction into the Arab civilization, and their spread to the West, we
  have more or less definite information. When, therefore, we consider the
  rise of the numerals in the land of the Sindhu,<a name="NtA_51"
  href="#Nt_51"><sup>[51]</sup></a> it must be understood that it is only
  the large movement that is meant, and that there must further be
  considered the numerous possible sources outside of India itself and long
  anterior to the first prominent appearance of the number symbols.</p>

  <p>No one attempts to examine any detail in the history of ancient India
  without being struck with the great dearth of reliable material.<a
  name="NtA_52" href="#Nt_52"><sup>[52]</sup></a> So little sympathy have
  the people with any save those of their own caste that a general
  literature is wholly lacking, and it is only in the observations of
  strangers that any all-round view of scientific progress is to be found.
  There is evidence that primary schools <!-- Page 15 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page15"></a>[15]</span>existed in earliest
  times, and of the seventy-two recognized sciences writing and arithmetic
  were the most prized.<a name="NtA_53" href="#Nt_53"><sup>[53]</sup></a>
  In the Vedic period, say from 2000 to 1400 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>, there was the same attention to astronomy that
  was found in the earlier civilizations of Babylon, China, and Egypt, a
  fact attested by the Vedas themselves.<a name="NtA_54"
  href="#Nt_54"><sup>[54]</sup></a> Such advance in science presupposes a
  fair knowledge of calculation, but of the manner of calculating we are
  quite ignorant and probably always shall be. One of the Buddhist sacred
  books, the <i>Lalitavistara</i>, relates that when the
  B&#x14D;dhisattva<a name="NtA_55" href="#Nt_55"><sup>[55]</sup></a> was
  of age to marry, the father of Gopa, his intended bride, demanded an
  examination of the five hundred suitors, the subjects including
  arithmetic, writing, the lute, and archery. Having vanquished his rivals
  in all else, he is matched against Arjuna the great arithmetician and is
  asked to express numbers greater than 100 kotis.<a name="NtA_56"
  href="#Nt_56"><sup>[56]</sup></a> In reply he gave a scheme of number
  names as high as 10<sup>53</sup>, adding that he could proceed as far as
  10<sup>421</sup>,<a name="NtA_57" href="#Nt_57"><sup>[57]</sup></a> all
  of which suggests the system of Archimedes and the unsettled question of
  the indebtedness of the West to the East in the realm of ancient
  mathematics.<a name="NtA_58" href="#Nt_58"><sup>[58]</sup></a> Sir Edwin
  Arnold, <!-- Page 16 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  mention this part of the contest, but he speaks of Buddha's training at

  <p>Thereupon <span class="special" title="Visvamitra Acarya"
  >Vi&#x1E63;vamitra &#x100;c&#x101;rya</span><a name="NtA_61"
  href="#Nt_61"><sup>[61]</sup></a> expresses his approval of the task, and
  asks to hear the "measure of the line" as far as y&#x14D;jana, the
  longest measure bearing name. This given, Buddha adds:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>... "'And master! if it please,</p>
      <p>I shall recite how many sun-motes lie</p>

      <p>Art G&#x16B;r&#x16B;.'"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It is needless to say that this is far from being history. And yet it
  puts in charming rhythm only what the ancient <i>Lalitavistara</i>
  relates of the number-series of the Buddha's time. While it extends
  beyond all reason, nevertheless it reveals a condition that would have
  been impossible unless arithmetic had attained a considerable degree of
  advancement.</p>

  <p>To this pre-Christian period belong also the <i><span class="special"
  title="Vedangas">Ved&#x101;&#x1E45;gas</span></i>, or "limbs for
  supporting the Veda," part of that great branch of Hindu literature known
  as <i><span class="special" title="Smriti">Sm&#x1E5B;iti</span></i>
  (recollection), that which was to be handed down by tradition. Of these
  the sixth is known as <i><span class="special"
  title="Jyotisa">Jyoti&#x1E63;a</span></i> (astronomy), a short treatise
  of only thirty-six verses, written not earlier than 300 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>, and affording us some knowledge of the extent
  of number work in that period.<a name="NtA_62"
  href="#Nt_62"><sup>[62]</sup></a> The Hindus <!-- Page 18 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page18"></a>[18]</span>also speak of eighteen
  ancient Siddh&#x101;ntas or astronomical works, which, though mostly
  lost, confirm this evidence.<a name="NtA_63"
  href="#Nt_63"><sup>[63]</sup></a></p>

  <p>As to authentic histories, however, there exist in India none relating
  to the period before the Mohammedan era (622 <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span>). About all that we know of the earlier
  civilization is what we glean from the two great epics, the
  Mah&#x101;bh&#x101;rata<a name="NtA_64" href="#Nt_64"><sup>[64]</sup></a>
  and the R&#x101;m&#x101;yana, from coins, and from a few inscriptions.<a
  name="NtA_65" href="#Nt_65"><sup>[65]</sup></a></p>

  <p>It is with this unsatisfactory material, then, that we have to deal in
  searching for the early history of the Hindu-Arabic numerals, and the
  fact that many unsolved problems exist and will continue to exist is no
  longer strange when we consider the conditions. It is rather surprising
  that so much has been discovered within a century, than that we are so
  uncertain as to origins and dates and the early spread of the system. The
  probability being that writing was not introduced into India before the
  close of the fourth century <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, and
  literature existing only in spoken form prior to that period,<a
  name="NtA_66" href="#Nt_66"><sup>[66]</sup></a> the number work was
  doubtless that of all primitive peoples, palpable, merely a matter of
  placing sticks or cowries or pebbles on the ground, of marking a
  sand-covered board, or of cutting notches or tying cords as is still done
  in parts of Southern India to-day.<a name="NtA_67"
  href="#Nt_67"><sup>[67]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 19 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page19"></a>[19]</span></p>

  <p>The early Hindu numerals<a name="NtA_68"
  href="#Nt_68"><sup>[68]</sup></a> may be classified into three great
  groups, (1) the <span class="special"
  title="Kharosthi">Kharo&#x1E63;&#x1E6D;h&#x12B;</span>, (2) the
  Br&#x101;hm&#x12B;, and (3) the word and letter forms; and these will be
  considered in order.</p>

  <p>The <span class="special"
  title="Kharosthi">Kharo&#x1E63;&#x1E6D;h&#x12B;</span> numerals are found
  in inscriptions formerly known as Bactrian, Indo-Bactrian, and Aryan, and
  appearing in ancient Gandh&#x101;ra, now eastern Afghanistan and northern
  Punjab. The alphabet of the language is found in inscriptions dating from
  the fourth century <span class="scac">B.C.</span> to the third century
  <span class="scac">A.D.</span>, and from the fact that the words are
  written from right to left it is assumed to be of Semitic origin. No
  numerals, however, have been found in the earliest of these inscriptions,
  number-names probably having been written out in words as was the custom
  with many ancient peoples. Not until the time of the powerful King
  A&#x15B;oka, in the third century <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, do
  numerals appear in any inscriptions thus far discovered; and then only in
  the primitive form of marks, quite as they would be found in Egypt,
  Greece, Rome, or in <!-- Page 20 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page20"></a>[20]</span>various other parts of the world. These
  A&#x15B;oka<a name="NtA_69" href="#Nt_69"><sup>[69]</sup></a>
  inscriptions, some thirty in all, are found in widely separated parts of
  India, often on columns, and are in the various vernaculars that were
  familiar to the people. Two are in the <span class="special"
  title="Kharosthi">Kharo&#x1E63;&#x1E6D;h&#x12B;</span> characters, and
  the rest in some form of Br&#x101;hm&#x12B;. In the <span class="special"
  title="Kharosthi">Kharo&#x1E63;&#x1E6D;h&#x12B;</span> inscriptions only
  four numerals have been found, and these are merely vertical marks for
  one, two, four, and five, thus:</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:25%;">
      <a href="images/026a.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/026a.png"
      alt="Numerals in Kharosthi inscriptions." title="Numerals in Kharosthi inscriptions." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>In the so-called &#x15A;aka inscriptions, possibly of the first
  century <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, more numerals are found, and in
  more highly developed form, the right-to-left system appearing, together
  with evidences of three different scales of counting,&mdash;four, ten,
  and twenty. The numerals of this period are as follows:</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:50%;">
      <a href="images/026b.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/026b.png"
      alt="Numerals in Saka inscriptions." title="Numerals in Saka inscriptions." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>There are several noteworthy points to be observed in studying this
  system. In the first place, it is probably not as early as that shown in
  the N&#x101;n&#x101; Gh&#x101;t forms hereafter given, although the
  inscriptions themselves at N&#x101;n&#x101; Gh&#x101;t are later than
  those of the A&#x15B;oka period. The <!-- Page 21 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page21"></a>[21]</span>four is to this system
  what the X was to the Roman, probably a canceling of three marks as a
  workman does to-day for five, or a laying of one stick across three
  others. The ten has never been satisfactorily explained. It is similar to
  the A of the <span class="special"
  title="Kharosthi">Kharo&#x1E63;&#x1E6D;h&#x12B;</span> alphabet, but we
  have no knowledge as to why it was chosen. The twenty is evidently a
  ligature of two tens, and this in turn suggested a kind of radix, so that
  ninety was probably written in a way reminding one of the
  quatre-vingt-dix of the French. The hundred is unexplained, although it
  resembles the letter <i>ta</i> or <i>tra</i> of the Br&#x101;hm&#x12B;
  alphabet with 1 before (to the right of) it. The two hundred is only a
  variant of the symbol for hundred, with two vertical marks.<a
  name="NtA_70" href="#Nt_70"><sup>[70]</sup></a></p>

  <p>This system has many points of similarity with the Nabatean numerals<a
  name="NtA_71" href="#Nt_71"><sup>[71]</sup></a> in use in the first
  centuries of the Christian era. The cross is here used for four, and the
  <span class="special"
  title="Kharosthi">Kharo&#x1E63;&#x1E6D;h&#x12B;</span> form is employed
  for twenty. In addition to this there is a trace of an analogous use of a
  scale of twenty. While the symbol for 100 is quite different, the method
  of forming the other hundreds is the same. The correspondence seems to be
  too marked to be wholly accidental.</p>

  <p>It is not in the <span class="special"
  title="Kharosthi">Kharo&#x1E63;&#x1E6D;h&#x12B;</span> numerals,
  therefore, that we can hope to find the origin of those used by us, and
  we turn to the second of the Indian types, the Br&#x101;hm&#x12B;
  characters. The alphabet attributed to Brahm&#x101; is the oldest of the
  several known in India, and was used from the earliest historic times.
  There are various theories of its origin, <!-- Page 22 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page22"></a>[22]</span>none of which has as yet
  any wide acceptance,<a name="NtA_72" href="#Nt_72"><sup>[72]</sup></a>
  although the problem offers hope of solution in due time. The numerals
  are not as old as the alphabet, or at least they have not as yet been
  found in inscriptions earlier than those in which the edicts of
  A&#x15B;oka appear, some of these having been incised in
  Br&#x101;hm&#x12B; as well as <span class="special"
  title="Kharosthi">Kharo&#x1E63;&#x1E6D;h&#x12B;</span>. As already
  stated, the older writers probably wrote the numbers in words, as seems
  to have been the case in the earliest Pali writings of Ceylon.<a
  name="NtA_73" href="#Nt_73"><sup>[73]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The following numerals are, as far as known, the only ones to appear
  in the A&#x15B;oka edicts:<a name="NtA_74"
  href="#Nt_74"><sup>[74]</sup></a></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:50%;">
      <a href="images/028a.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/028a.png"
      alt="Numerals in Asoka edicts." title="Numerals in Asoka edicts." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>These fragments from the third century <span class="scac">B.C.</span>,
  crude and unsatisfactory as they are, are the undoubted early forms from
  which our present system developed. They next appear in the second
  century <span class="scac">B.C.</span> in some inscriptions in the cave
  on the top of the N&#x101;n&#x101; Gh&#x101;t hill, about seventy-five
  miles from Poona in central India. These inscriptions may be memorials of
  the early Andhra dynasty of southern India, but their chief interest lies
  in the numerals which they contain.</p>

  <p>The cave was made as a resting-place for travelers ascending the hill,
  which lies on the road from Kaly&#x101;na to Junar. It seems to have been
  cut out by a descendant <!-- Page 23 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page23"></a>[23]</span>of King &#x15A;&#x101;tav&#x101;hana,<a
  name="NtA_75" href="#Nt_75"><sup>[75]</sup></a> for inside the wall
  opposite the entrance are representations of the members of his family,
  much defaced, but with the names still legible. It would seem that the
  excavation was made by order of a king named Vedisiri, and "the
  inscription contains a list of gifts made on the occasion of the
  performance of several <i>yagnas</i> or religious sacrifices," and
  numerals are to be seen in no less than thirty places.<a name="NtA_76"
  href="#Nt_76"><sup>[76]</sup></a></p>

  <p>There is considerable dispute as to what numerals are really found in
  these inscriptions, owing to the difficulty of deciphering them; but the
  following, which have been copied from a rubbing, are probably number
  forms:<a name="NtA_77" href="#Nt_77"><sup>[77]</sup></a></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:50%;">
      <a href="images/029a.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/029a.png"
      alt="Numerals from Nana Ghat inscriptions." title="Numerals from Nana Ghat inscriptions." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>The inscription itself, so important as containing the earliest
  considerable Hindu numeral system connected with our own, is of
  sufficient interest to warrant reproducing part of it in facsimile, as is
  done on page 24.</p>

<p><!-- Page 24 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page24"></a>[24]</span></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:50%;">

      alt="Nânâghât Inscriptions." title="Nânâghât Inscriptions." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>The next very noteworthy evidence of the numerals, and this quite
  complete as will be seen, is found in certain other cave inscriptions
  dating back to the first or second century <span class="scac">A.D.</span>
  In these, the Nasik<a name="NtA_78" href="#Nt_78"><sup>[78]</sup></a>
  cave inscriptions, the forms are as follows:</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:50%;">

      alt="Numerals from Nasik cave inscriptions." title="Numerals from Nasik cave inscriptions." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>From this time on, until the decimal system finally adopted the first
  nine characters and replaced the rest of the Br&#x101;hm&#x12B; notation
  by adding the zero, the progress of these forms is well marked. It is
  therefore well to present synoptically the best-known specimens that have
  come down to us, and this is done in the table on page 25.<a

  <p>With respect to these numerals it should first be noted that no zero
  appears in the table, and as a matter of fact none existed in any of the
  cases cited. It was therefore impossible to have any place value, and the
  numbers like twenty, thirty, and other multiples of ten, one hundred, and
  so on, required separate symbols except where they were written out in
  words. The ancient Hindus had no less than twenty of these symbols,<a
  name="NtA_92" href="#Nt_92"><sup>[92]</sup></a> a number that was
  afterward greatly increased. The following are examples of their method
  of indicating certain numbers between one hundred and one thousand:</p>

  <p>We have thus far spoken of the <span class="special"
  title="Kharosthi">Kharo&#x1E63;&#x1E6D;h&#x12B;</span> and
  Br&#x101;hm&#x12B; numerals, and it remains to mention the third type,
  the word and letter forms. These are, however, so closely connected with
  the perfecting of the system by the invention of the zero that they are
  more appropriately considered in the next chapter, particularly as they
  have little relation to the problem of the origin of the forms known as
  the Arabic.</p>

  <p>Having now examined types of the early forms it is appropriate to turn
  our attention to the question of their origin. As to the first three
  there is no question. The <a href="images/033c.png"><img
  src="images/033c.png" class="middle" style="height:1.5ex" alt="1 vertical
  stroke" /></a> or <a href="images/033d.png"><img src="images/033d.png"
  class="middle" style="height:1.5ex" alt="1 horizontal stroke" /></a> is
  simply one stroke, or one stick laid down by the computer. The <a
  href="images/033e.png"><img src="images/033e.png" class="middle"
  style="height:1.5ex" alt="2 vertical strokes" /></a> or <a
  href="images/033f.png"><img src="images/033f.png" class="middle"
  style="height:1.5ex" alt="2 horizontal strokes" /></a> represents two
  strokes or two sticks, and so for the <a href="images/033g.png"><img
  src="images/033g.png" class="middle" style="height:1.5ex" alt="3 vertical
  strokes" /></a> and <a href="images/033h.png"><img src="images/033h.png"
  class="middle" style="height:1.5ex" alt="3 horizontal strokes" /></a>.
  From some primitive <a href="images/033e.png"><img src="images/033e.png"
  class="middle" style="height:1.5ex" alt="2 vertical strokes" /></a> came
  the two of Egypt, of Rome, of early Greece, and of various other
  civilizations. It appears in the three Egyptian numeral systems in the
  following forms:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Hieroglyphic <a href="images/033e.png"><img src="images/033e.png" class="middle" style="height:1.5ex" alt="2 vertical strokes" /></a></p>
      <p>Hieratic     <a href="images/033i.png"><img src="images/033i.png" class="middle" style="height:1.7ex" alt="Hieratic 2" /></a></p>
      <p>Demotic      <a href="images/033j.png"><img src="images/033j.png" class="middle" style="height:1.7ex" alt="Demotic 2" /></a></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The last of these is merely a cursive form as in the Arabic <a
  href="images/033k.png"><img src="images/033k.png" class="middle"
  style="height:1.7ex" alt="Arabic 2" /></a>, which becomes our 2 if tipped
  through a right angle. From some primitive <a href="images/033f.png"><img
  src="images/033f.png" class="middle" style="height:1.5ex" alt="2
  horizontal strokes" /></a> came the Chinese <!-- Page 28 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page28"></a>[28]</span>symbol, which is
  practically identical with the symbols found commonly in India from 150
  <span class="scac">B.C.</span> to 700 <span class="scac">A.D.</span> In
  the cursive form it becomes <a href="images/034a.png"><img
  src="images/034a.png" class="middle" style="height:1.5ex" alt="2
  horizontal strokes joined" /></a>, and this was frequently used for two
  in Germany until the 18th century. It finally went into the modern form
  2, and the <a href="images/033h.png"><img src="images/033h.png"
  class="middle" style="height:1.5ex" alt="3 horizontal strokes" /></a> in
  the same way became our 3.</p>

  <p>There is, however, considerable ground for interesting speculation
  with respect to these first three numerals. The earliest Hindu forms were
  perpendicular. In the N&#x101;n&#x101; Gh&#x101;t inscriptions they are
  vertical. But long before either the A&#x15B;oka or the N&#x101;n&#x101;
  Gh&#x101;t inscriptions the Chinese were using the horizontal forms for
  the first three numerals, but a vertical arrangement for four.<a
  name="NtA_101" href="#Nt_101"><sup>[101]</sup></a> Now where did China
  get these forms? Surely not from India, for she had them, as her
  monuments and literature<a name="NtA_102"
  href="#Nt_102"><sup>[102]</sup></a> show, long before the Hindus knew
  them. The tradition is that China brought her civilization around the
  north of Tibet, from Mongolia, the primitive habitat being Mesopotamia,
  or possibly the oases of Turkestan. Now what numerals did Mesopotamia
  use? The Babylonian system, simple in its general principles but very
  complicated in many of its details, is now well known.<a name="NtA_103"
  href="#Nt_103"><sup>[103]</sup></a> In particular, one, two, and three
  were represented by vertical arrow-heads. Why, then, did the Chinese
  write <!-- Page 29 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page29"></a>[29]</span>theirs horizontally? The problem now takes a
  new interest when we find that these Babylonian forms were not the
  primitive ones of this region, but that the early Sumerian forms were
  horizontal.<a name="NtA_104" href="#Nt_104"><sup>[104]</sup></a></p>

  <p>What interpretation shall be given to these facts? Shall we say that
  it was mere accident that one people wrote "one" vertically and that
  another wrote it horizontally? This may be the case; but it may also be
  the case that the tribal migrations that ended in the Mongol invasion of
  China started from the Euphrates while yet the Sumerian civilization was
  prominent, or from some common source in Turkestan, and that they carried
  to the East the primitive numerals of their ancient home, the first
  three, these being all that the people as a whole knew or needed. It is
  equally possible that these three horizontal forms represent primitive
  stick-laying, the most natural position of a stick placed in front of a
  calculator being the horizontal one. When, however, the cuneiform writing
  developed more fully, the vertical form may have been proved the easier
  to make, so that by the time the migrations to the West began these were
  in use, and from them came the upright forms of Egypt, Greece, Rome, and
  other Mediterranean lands, and those of A&#x15B;oka's time in India.
  After A&#x15B;oka, and perhaps among the merchants of earlier centuries,
  the horizontal forms may have come down into India from China, thus
  giving those of the N&#x101;n&#x101; Gh&#x101;t cave and of later
  inscriptions. This is in the realm of speculation, but it is not
  improbable that further epigraphical studies may confirm the
  hypothesis.</p>

<p><!-- Page 30 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page30"></a>[30]</span></p>

  <p>As to the numerals above three there have been very many conjectures.
  The figure one of the Demotic looks like the one of the Sanskrit, the two
  (reversed) like that of the Arabic, the four has some resemblance to that
  in the Nasik caves, the five (reversed) to that on the <span
  class="special" title="Ksatrapa">K&#x1E63;atrapa</span> coins, the nine
  to that of the <span class="special" title="Kusana">Ku&#x1E63;ana</span>
  inscriptions, and other points of similarity have been imagined. Some
  have traced resemblance between the Hieratic five and seven and those of
  the Indian inscriptions. There have not, therefore, been wanting those
  who asserted an Egyptian origin for these numerals.<a name="NtA_105"
  href="#Nt_105"><sup>[105]</sup></a> There has already been mentioned the
  fact that the <span class="special"
  title="Kharosthi">Kharo&#x1E63;&#x1E6D;h&#x12B;</span> numerals were
  formerly known as Bactrian, Indo-Bactrian, and Aryan. Cunningham<a
  name="NtA_106" href="#Nt_106"><sup>[106]</sup></a> was the first to
  suggest that these numerals were derived from the alphabet of the
  Bactrian civilization of Eastern Persia, perhaps a thousand years before
  our era, and in this he was supported by the scholarly work of Sir E.
  Clive Bayley,<a name="NtA_107" href="#Nt_107"><sup>[107]</sup></a> who in
  turn was followed by Canon Taylor.<a name="NtA_108"

  convincing, however, and Bayley's drawings <!-- Page 31 --><span

  being affected by his theory. The following is part of the hypothesis:<a

  <p>Bühler<a name="NtA_110" href="#Nt_110"><sup>[110]</sup></a> rejects
  this hypothesis, stating that in four cases (four, six, seven, and ten)
  the facts are absolutely against it.</p>

  <p>While the relation to ancient Bactrian forms has been generally
  doubted, it is agreed that most of the numerals resemble
  Br&#x101;hm&#x12B; letters, and we would naturally expect them to be
  initials.<a name="NtA_111" href="#Nt_111"><sup>[111]</sup></a> But,
  knowing the ancient pronunciation of most of the number names,<a
  name="NtA_112" href="#Nt_112"><sup>[112]</sup></a> we find this not to be
  the case. We next fall back upon the hypothesis <!-- Page 32 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page32"></a>[32]</span>that they represent the
  order of letters<a name="NtA_113" href="#Nt_113"><sup>[113]</sup></a> in
  the ancient alphabet. From what we know of this order, however, there
  seems also no basis for this assumption. We have, therefore, to confess
  that we are not certain that the numerals were alphabetic at all, and if
  they were alphabetic we have no evidence at present as to the basis of
  selection. The later forms may possibly have been alphabetical
  expressions of certain syllables called <i><span class="special"
  title="aksaras">ak&#x1E63;aras</span></i>, which possessed in Sanskrit
  fixed numerical values,<a name="NtA_114"
  href="#Nt_114"><sup>[114]</sup></a> but this is equally uncertain with
  the rest. Bayley also thought<a name="NtA_115"
  href="#Nt_115"><sup>[115]</sup></a> that some of the forms were
  Ph&oelig;nician, as notably the use of a circle for twenty, but the
  resemblance is in general too remote to be convincing.</p>

  <p>There is also some slight possibility that Chinese influence is to be
  seen in certain of the early forms of Hindu numerals.<a name="NtA_116"
  href="#Nt_116"><sup>[116]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 33 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page33"></a>[33]</span></p>

  <p>More absurd is the hypothesis of a Greek origin, supposedly supported
  by derivation of the current symbols from the first nine letters of the
  Greek alphabet.<a name="NtA_117" href="#Nt_117"><sup>[117]</sup></a> This
  difficult feat is accomplished by twisting some of the letters, cutting
  off, adding on, and effecting other changes to make the letters fit the
  theory. This peculiar theory was first set up by Dasypodius<a
  name="NtA_118" href="#Nt_118"><sup>[118]</sup></a> (Conrad Rauhfuss), and
  was later elaborated by Huet.<a name="NtA_119"
  href="#Nt_119"><sup>[119]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 34 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page34"></a>[34]</span></p>

  <p>A bizarre derivation based upon early Arabic (c. 1040 <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span>) sources is given by Kircher in his work<a
  name="NtA_120" href="#Nt_120"><sup>[120]</sup></a> on number mysticism.
  He quotes from Abenragel,<a name="NtA_121"
  href="#Nt_121"><sup>[121]</sup></a> giving the Arabic and a Latin
  translation<a name="NtA_122" href="#Nt_122"><sup>[122]</sup></a> and
  stating that the ordinary Arabic forms are derived from sectors of a
  circle, <a href="images/040d.png"><img src="images/040d.png"
  class="middle" style="height:2ex" alt="circle" /></a>.</p>

  <p>Out of all these conflicting theories, and from all the resemblances
  seen or imagined between the numerals of the West and those of the East,
  what conclusions are we prepared to draw as the evidence now stands?
  Probably none that is satisfactory. Indeed, upon the evidence at <!--
  Page 35 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page35"></a>[35]</span>hand we
  might properly feel that everything points to the numerals as being
  substantially indigenous to India. And why should this not be the case?
  If the king Srong-tsan-Gampo (639 <span class="scac">A.D.</span>), the
  founder of Lh&#x101;sa,<a name="NtA_123"
  href="#Nt_123"><sup>[123]</sup></a> could have set about to devise a new
  alphabet for Tibet, and if the Siamese, and the Singhalese, and the
  Burmese, and other peoples in the East, could have created alphabets of
  their own, why should not the numerals also have been fashioned by some
  temple school, or some king, or some merchant guild? By way of
  illustration, there are shown in the table on page 36 certain systems of
  the East, and while a few resemblances are evident, it is also evident
  that the creators of each system endeavored to find original forms that
  should not be found in other systems. This, then, would seem to be a fair
  interpretation of the evidence. A human mind cannot readily create simple
  forms that are absolutely new; what it fashions will naturally resemble
  what other minds have fashioned, or what it has known through hearsay or
  through sight. A circle is one of the world's common stock of figures,
  and that it should mean twenty in Ph&oelig;nicia and in India is hardly
  more surprising than that it signified ten at one time in Babylon.<a
  name="NtA_124" href="#Nt_124"><sup>[124]</sup></a> It is therefore quite
  probable that an extraneous origin cannot be found for the very
  sufficient reason that none exists.</p>

  <p>Of absolute nonsense about the origin of the symbols which we use much
  has been written. Conjectures, <!-- Page 36 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page36"></a>[36]</span>however, without any historical evidence for
  support, have no place in a serious discussion of the gradual evolution
  of the present numeral forms.<a name="NtA_125"

  <p>We may summarize this chapter by saying that no one knows what
  suggested certain of the early numeral forms used in India. The origin of
  some is evident, but the origin of others will probably never be known.
  There is no reason why they should not have been invented by some priest
  or teacher or guild, by the order of some king, or as part of the
  mysticism of some temple. Whatever the origin, they were no better than
  scores of other ancient systems and no better than the present Chinese
  system when written without the zero, and there would never have been any
  chance of their triumphal progress westward had it not been for this
  relatively late symbol. There could hardly be demanded a stronger proof
  of the Hindu origin of the character for zero than this, and to it
  further reference will be made in Chapter IV.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<p class="cenhead">LATER HINDU FORMS, WITH A PLACE VALUE</p>

  <p>Before speaking of the perfected Hindu numerals with the zero and the
  place value, it is necessary to consider the third system mentioned on
  page 19,&mdash;the word and letter forms. The use of words with place
  value began at least as early as the 6th century of the Christian era. In
  many of the manuals of astronomy and mathematics, and often in other
  works in mentioning dates, numbers are represented by the names of
  certain objects or ideas. For example, zero is represented by "the void"
  (<i>&#x15B;&#x16B;nya</i>), or "heaven-space" (<i>ambara
  &#x101;k&#x101;&#x15B;a</i>); one by "stick" (<i>rupa</i>), "moon"
  (<i>indu &#x15B;a&#x15B;in</i>), "earth" (<i>bh&#x16B;</i>), "beginning"
  (<i>&#x101;di</i>), "Brahma," or, in general, by anything markedly
  unique; two by "the twins" (<i>yama</i>), "hands" (<i>kara</i>), "eyes"
  (<i>nayana</i>), etc.; four by "oceans," five by "senses" (<i><span
  class="special" title="visaya">vi&#x1E63;aya</span></i>) or "arrows" (the
  five arrows of K&#x101;mad&#x113;va); six by "seasons" or "flavors";
  seven by "mountain" (<i>aga</i>), and so on.<a name="NtA_130"
  href="#Nt_130"><sup>[130]</sup></a> These names, accommodating themselves
  to the verse in which scientific works were written, had the additional
  advantage of not admitting, as did the figures, easy alteration, since
  any change would tend to disturb the meter.</p>

<p><!-- Page 39 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page39"></a>[39]</span></p>

  <p>As an example of this system, the date "<span class="special"
  title="Saka Samvat">&#x15A;aka Sa&#x1E43;vat</span>, 867" (<span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 945 or 946), is given by "<i><span
  class="special" title="giri-rasa-vasu">giri-ra&#x1E63;a-vasu</span></i>,"
  meaning "the mountains" (seven), "the flavors" (six), and the gods
  "<i>Vasu</i>" of which there were eight. In reading the date these are
  read from right to left.<a name="NtA_131"
  href="#Nt_131"><sup>[131]</sup></a> The period of invention of this
  system is uncertain. The first trace seems to be in the
  <i>&#x15A;rautas&#x16B;tra</i> of K&#x101;ty&#x101;yana and <span
  class="special" title="Latyayana">L&#x101;&#x1E6D;y&#x101;yana</span>.<a
  name="NtA_132" href="#Nt_132"><sup>[132]</sup></a> It was certainly known
  to Var&#x101;ha-Mihira (d. 587),<a name="NtA_133"
  href="#Nt_133"><sup>[133]</sup></a> for he used it in the <i><span
  class="special"
  title="Brhat-Samhita">B&#x1E5B;hat-Sa&#x1E43;hit&#x101;</span>.</i><a
  name="NtA_134" href="#Nt_134"><sup>[134]</sup></a> It has also been
  asserted<a name="NtA_135" href="#Nt_135"><sup>[135]</sup></a> that <span
  class="special" title="Aryabhata">&#x100;ryabha&#x1E6D;a</span> (c. 500
  <span class="scac">A.D.</span>) was familiar with this system, but there
  is nothing to prove the statement.<a name="NtA_136"
  href="#Nt_136"><sup>[136]</sup></a> The earliest epigraphical examples of
  the system are found in the Bayang (Cambodia) inscriptions of 604 and 624
  <span class="scac">A.D.</span><a name="NtA_137"
  href="#Nt_137"><sup>[137]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Mention should also be made, in this connection, of a curious system
  of alphabetic numerals that sprang up in southern India. In this we have
  the numerals represented by the letters as given in the following
  table:</p>

<table class="nobctr">
<tr><td style="width:6%">1</td><td style="width:6%">2</td><td style="width:6%">3</td><td style="width:6%">4</td><td style="width:6%">5</td><td style="width:6%">6</td><td style="width:6%">7</td><td style="width:6%">8</td><td style="width:6%">9</td><td style="width:6%">0</td></tr>
<tr><td>k</td><td>kh</td><td>g</td><td>gh</td><td> <span class="special" title="n-dot-above">&#x1E45;</span></td><td>c</td><td>ch</td><td>j</td><td>jh</td><td>ñ</td></tr>

</table>

<p><!-- Page 40 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page40"></a>[40]</span></p>

  <p>By this plan a numeral might be represented by any one of several
  letters, as shown in the preceding table, and thus it could the more
  easily be formed into a word for mnemonic purposes. For example, the
  word</p>

<table class="nobctr">

  <p>has the value 1,565,132, reading from right to left.<a name="NtA_138"
  href="#Nt_138"><sup>[138]</sup></a> This, the oldest specimen (1184 <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span>) known of this notation, is given in a
  commentary on the Rigveda, representing the number of days that had
  elapsed from the beginning of the Kaliyuga. Burnell<a name="NtA_139"
  href="#Nt_139"><sup>[139]</sup></a> states that this system is even yet
  in use for remembering rules to calculate horoscopes, and for
  astronomical tables.</p>

  <p>A second system of this kind is still used in the pagination of
  manuscripts in Ceylon, Siam, and Burma, having also had its rise in
  southern India. In this the thirty-four consonants when followed by
  <i>a</i> (as <i>ka</i> ... <i>la</i>) designate the numbers 1-34; by
  <i>&#x101;</i> (as <i>k&#x101;</i> ... <i>l&#x101;</i>), those from 35 to
  68; by <i>i</i> (<i>ki</i> ... <i>li</i>), those from 69 to 102,
  inclusive; and so on.<a name="NtA_140"
  href="#Nt_140"><sup>[140]</sup></a></p>

  <p>As already stated, however, the Hindu system as thus far described was
  no improvement upon many others of the ancients, such as those used by
  the Greeks and the Hebrews. Having no zero, it was impracticable to
  designate the tens, hundreds, and other units of higher order by the same
  symbols used for the units from one to nine. In other words, there was no
  possibility of place value without some further improvement. So the
  N&#x101;n&#x101; Gh&#x101;t <!-- Page 41 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page41"></a>[41]</span>symbols required the writing of "thousand
  seven twenty-four" about like T 7, tw, 4 in modern symbols, instead of
  7024, in which the seven of the thousands, the two of the tens (concealed
  in the word twenty, being originally "twain of tens," the <i>-ty</i>
  signifying ten), and the four of the units are given as spoken and the
  order of the unit (tens, hundreds, etc.) is given by the place. To
  complete the system only the zero was needed; but it was probably eight
  centuries after the N&#x101;n&#x101; Gh&#x101;t inscriptions were cut,
  before this important symbol appeared; and not until a considerably later
  period did it become well known. Who it was to whom the invention is due,
  or where he lived, or even in what century, will probably always remain a
  mystery.<a name="NtA_141" href="#Nt_141"><sup>[141]</sup></a> It is
  possible that one of the forms of ancient abacus suggested to some Hindu
  astronomer or mathematician the use of a symbol to stand for the vacant
  line when the counters were removed. It is well established that in
  different parts of India the names of the higher powers took different
  forms, even the order being interchanged.<a name="NtA_142"
  href="#Nt_142"><sup>[142]</sup></a> Nevertheless, as the significance of
  the name of the unit was given by the order in reading, these variations
  did not lead to error. Indeed the variation itself may have necessitated
  the introduction of a word to signify a vacant place or lacking unit,
  with the ultimate introduction of a zero symbol for this word.</p>

  <p>To enable us to appreciate the force of this argument a large number,
  8,443,682,155, may be considered as the Hindus wrote and read it, and
  then, by way of contrast, as the Greeks and Arabs would have read it.</p>

  <p>As Woepcke<a name="NtA_143" href="#Nt_143"><sup>[143]</sup></a>
  pointed out, the reading of numbers of this kind shows that the notation
  adopted by the Hindus tended to bring out the place idea. No other
  language than the Sanskrit has made such consistent application, in
  numeration, of the decimal system of numbers. The introduction of myriads
  as in the Greek, and thousands as in Arabic and in modern numeration, is
  really a step away from a decimal scheme. So in the numbers below one
  hundred, in English, eleven and twelve are out of harmony with the rest
  of the -teens, while the naming of all the numbers between ten and twenty
  is not analogous to the naming of the numbers above twenty. To conform to
  our written system we should have ten-one, ten-two, ten-three, and so on,
  as we have twenty-one, twenty-two, and the like. The Sanskrit is
  consistent, the units, however, preceding the tens and hundreds. Nor did
  any other ancient people carry the numeration as far as did the Hindus.<a

  <p>When the <i><span class="special"
  title="ankapalli">a&#x1E45;kapalli</span></i>,<a name="NtA_145"
  href="#Nt_145"><sup>[145]</sup></a> the decimal-place system of writing
  numbers, was perfected, the tenth symbol was called the
  <i>&#x15B;&#x16B;nyabindu</i>, generally shortened to
  <i>&#x15B;&#x16B;nya</i> (the void). Brockhaus<a name="NtA_146"
  href="#Nt_146"><sup>[146]</sup></a> has well said that if there was any
  invention for which the Hindus, by all their philosophy and religion,
  were well fitted, it was the invention of a symbol for zero. This making
  of nothingness the crux of a tremendous achievement was a step in
  complete harmony with the genius of the Hindu.</p>

  <p>It is generally thought that this <i>&#x15B;&#x16B;nya</i> as a symbol
  was not used before about 500 <span class="scac">A.D.</span>, although
  some writers have placed it earlier.<a name="NtA_147"
  href="#Nt_147"><sup>[147]</sup></a> Since <span class="special"
  title="Aryabhata">&#x100;ryabha&#x1E6D;a</span> gives our common method
  of extracting roots, it would seem that he may have known a decimal
  notation,<a name="NtA_148" href="#Nt_148"><sup>[148]</sup></a> although
  he did not use the characters from which our numerals are derived.<a
  name="NtA_149" href="#Nt_149"><sup>[149]</sup></a> Moreover, he
  frequently speaks of the <!-- Page 44 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page44"></a>[44]</span>void.<a name="NtA_150"
  href="#Nt_150"><sup>[150]</sup></a> If he refers to a symbol this would
  put the zero as far back as 500 <span class="scac">A.D.</span>, but of
  course he may have referred merely to the concept of nothingness.</p>

  <p>A little later, but also in the sixth century, Var&#x101;ha-Mihira<a
  name="NtA_151" href="#Nt_151"><sup>[151]</sup></a> wrote a work entitled
  <i><span class="special" title="Brhat Samhita">B&#x1E5B;hat
  Sa&#x1E43;hit&#x101;</span></i><a name="NtA_152"
  href="#Nt_152"><sup>[152]</sup></a> in which he frequently uses
  <i>&#x15B;&#x16B;nya</i> in speaking of numerals, so that it has been
  thought that he was referring to a definite symbol. This, of course,
  would add to the probability that <span class="special"
  title="Aryabhata">&#x100;ryabha&#x1E6D;a</span> was doing the same.</p>

  <p>It should also be mentioned as a matter of interest, and somewhat
  related to the question at issue, that Var&#x101;ha-Mihira used the
  word-system with place value<a name="NtA_153"
  href="#Nt_153"><sup>[153]</sup></a> as explained above.</p>

  <p>The first kind of alphabetic numerals and also the word-system (in
  both of which the place value is used) are plays upon, or variations of,
  position arithmetic, which would be most likely to occur in the country
  of its origin.<a name="NtA_154" href="#Nt_154"><sup>[154]</sup></a></p>

  <p>At the opening of the next century (c. 620 <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span>) <span class="special"
  title="Bana">B&#x101;&#x1E47;a</span><a name="NtA_155"
  href="#Nt_155"><sup>[155]</sup></a> wrote of Subandhus's
  <i>V&#x101;savadatt&#x101;</i> as a celebrated work, <!-- Page 45
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page45"></a>[45]</span>and mentioned
  that the stars dotting the sky are here compared with zeros, these being
  points as in the modern Arabic system. On the other hand, a strong
  argument against any Hindu knowledge of the symbol zero at this time is
  the fact that about 700 <span class="scac">A.D.</span> the Arabs overran
  the province of Sind and thus had an opportunity of knowing the common
  methods used there for writing numbers. And yet, when they received the
  complete system in 776 they looked upon it as something new.<a
  name="NtA_156" href="#Nt_156"><sup>[156]</sup></a> Such evidence is not
  conclusive, but it tends to show that the complete system was probably
  not in common use in India at the beginning of the eighth century. On the
  other hand, we must bear in mind the fact that a traveler in Germany in
  the year 1700 would probably have heard or seen nothing of decimal
  fractions, although these were perfected a century before that date. The
  élite of the mathematicians may have known the zero even in <span
  class="special" title="Aryabhata">&#x100;ryabha&#x1E6D;a</span>'s time,
  while the merchants and the common people may not have grasped the
  significance of the novelty until a long time after. On the whole, the
  evidence seems to point to the west coast of India as the region where
  the complete system was first seen.<a name="NtA_157"
  href="#Nt_157"><sup>[157]</sup></a> As mentioned above, traces of the
  numeral words with place value, which do not, however, absolutely require
  a decimal place-system of symbols, are found very early in Cambodia, as
  well as in India.</p>

  <p>Concerning the earliest epigraphical instances of the use of the nine
  symbols, plus the zero, with place value, there <!-- Page 46 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page46"></a>[46]</span>is some question.
  Colebrooke<a name="NtA_158" href="#Nt_158"><sup>[158]</sup></a> in 1807
  warned against the possibility of forgery in many of the ancient
  copper-plate land grants. On this account Fleet, in the <i>Indian
  Antiquary</i>,<a name="NtA_159" href="#Nt_159"><sup>[159]</sup></a>
  discusses at length this phase of the work of the epigraphists in India,
  holding that many of these forgeries were made about the end of the
  eleventh century. Colebrooke<a name="NtA_160"
  href="#Nt_160"><sup>[160]</sup></a> takes a more rational view of these
  forgeries than does Kaye, who seems to hold that they tend to invalidate
  the whole Indian hypothesis. "But even where that may be suspected, the
  historical uses of a monument fabricated so much nearer to the times to
  which it assumes to belong, will not be entirely superseded. The
  necessity of rendering the forged grant credible would compel a
  fabricator to adhere to history, and conform to established notions: and
  the tradition, which prevailed in his time, and by which he must be
  guided, would probably be so much nearer to the truth, as it was less
  remote from the period which it concerned."<a name="NtA_161"
  href="#Nt_161"><sup>[161]</sup></a> Bühler<a name="NtA_162"
  href="#Nt_162"><sup>[162]</sup></a> gives the copper-plate Gurjara
  inscription of <span class="special"
  title="Cedi-samvat">Cedi-sa&#x1E43;vat</span> 346 (595 <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span>) as the oldest epigraphical use of the
  numerals<a name="NtA_163" href="#Nt_163"><sup>[163]</sup></a> "in which
  the symbols correspond to the alphabet numerals of the period and the
  place." Vincent A. Smith<a name="NtA_164"
  href="#Nt_164"><sup>[164]</sup></a> quotes a stone inscription of 815
  <span class="scac">A.D.</span>, dated <span class="special"
  title="Samvat">Sa&#x1E43;vat</span> 872. So F. Kielhorn in the
  <i>Epigraphia Indica</i><a name="NtA_165"
  href="#Nt_165"><sup>[165]</sup></a> gives a Pathari pillar inscription of
  Parabala, dated <span class="special"
  title="Vikrama-samvat">Vikrama-sa&#x1E43;vat</span> 917, which
  corresponds to 861 <span class="scac">A.D.</span>, <!-- Page 47 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page47"></a>[47]</span>and refers also to
  another copper-plate inscription dated <span class="special"
  title="Vikrama-samvat">Vikrama-sa&#x1E43;vat</span> 813 (756 <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span>). The inscription quoted by V. A. Smith above is
  that given by D. R. Bhandarkar,<a name="NtA_166"
  href="#Nt_166"><sup>[166]</sup></a> and another is given by the same
  writer as of date <span class="special"
  title="Saka-samvat">Saka-sa&#x1E43;vat</span> 715 (798 <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span>), being incised on a pilaster. Kielhorn<a
  name="NtA_167" href="#Nt_167"><sup>[167]</sup></a> also gives two
  copper-plate inscriptions of the time of Mahendrapala of Kanauj, <span
  class="special" title="Valhabi-samvat">Valhab&#x12B;-sa&#x1E43;vat</span>
  574 (893 <span class="scac">A.D.</span>) and <span class="special"
  title="Vikrama-samvat">Vikrama-sa&#x1E43;vat</span> 956 (899 <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span>). That there should be any inscriptions of date
  as early even as 750 <span class="scac">A.D.</span>, would tend to show
  that the system was at least a century older. As will be shown in the
  further development, it was more than two centuries after the
  introduction of the numerals into Europe that they appeared there upon
  coins and inscriptions. While Thibaut<a name="NtA_168"
  href="#Nt_168"><sup>[168]</sup></a> does not consider it necessary to
  quote any specific instances of the use of the numerals, he states that
  traces are found from 590 <span class="scac">A.D.</span> on. "That the
  system now in use by all civilized nations is of Hindu origin cannot be
  doubted; no other nation has any claim upon its discovery, especially
  since the references to the origin of the system which are found in the
  nations of western Asia point unanimously towards India."<a
  name="NtA_169" href="#Nt_169"><sup>[169]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The testimony and opinions of men like Bühler, Kielhorn, V. A. Smith,
  Bhandarkar, and Thibaut are entitled to the most serious consideration.
  As authorities on ancient Indian epigraphy no others rank higher. Their
  work is accepted by Indian scholars the world over, and their united
  judgment as to the rise of the system with a place value&mdash;that it
  took place in India as early as the <!-- Page 48 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page48"></a>[48]</span>sixth century <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span>&mdash;must stand unless new evidence of great
  weight can be submitted to the contrary.</p>

  <p>Many early writers remarked upon the diversity of Indian numeral
  forms. Al-B&#x12B;r&#x16B;n&#x12B; was probably the first; noteworthy is
  also Johannes Hispalensis,<a name="NtA_170"
  href="#Nt_170"><sup>[170]</sup></a> who gives the variant forms for seven
  and four. We insert on p. 49 a table of numerals used with place value.
  While the chief authority for this is Bühler,<a name="NtA_171"
  href="#Nt_171"><sup>[171]</sup></a> several specimens are given which are
  not found in his work and which are of unusual interest.</p>

  <p>The &#x15A;&#x101;rad&#x101; forms given in the table use the circle
  as a symbol for 1 and the dot for zero. They are taken from the paging
  and text of <i>The Kashmirian Atharva-Veda</i><a name="NtA_172"
  href="#Nt_172"><sup>[172]</sup></a>, of which the manuscript used is
  certainly four hundred years old. Similar forms are found in a manuscript
  belonging to the University of Tübingen. Two other series presented are
  from Tibetan books in the library of one of the authors.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<p class="cenhead">THE SYMBOL ZERO</p>

  <p>What has been said of the improved Hindu system with a place value
  does not touch directly the origin of a symbol for zero, although it
  assumes that such a symbol exists. The importance of such a sign, the
  fact that it is a prerequisite to a place-value system, and the further
  fact that without it the Hindu-Arabic numerals would never have dominated
  the computation system of the western world, make it proper to devote a
  chapter to its origin and history.</p>

  <p>It was some centuries after the primitive Br&#x101;hm&#x12B; and <span
  class="special" title="Kharosthi">Kharo&#x1E63;&#x1E6D;h&#x12B;</span>
  numerals had made their appearance in India that the zero first appeared
  there, although such a character was used by the Babylonians<a
  name="NtA_185" href="#Nt_185"><sup>[185]</sup></a> in the centuries
  immediately preceding the Christian era. The symbol is <a
  href="images/057a.png"><img src="images/057a.png" class="middle"
  style="height:2ex" alt="Babylonian zero symbol" /></a> or <a
  href="images/057b.png"><img src="images/057b.png" class="middle"
  style="height:2ex" alt="Babylonian zero symbol" /></a>, and apparently it
  was not used in calculation. Nor does it always occur when units of any
  order are lacking; thus 180 is written <a href="images/057c.png"><img
  src="images/057c.png" class="middle" style="height:2.2ex" alt="Babylonian
  numerals 180" /></a> with the meaning three sixties and no units, since
  181 immediately following is <a href="images/057d.png"><img
  src="images/057d.png" class="middle" style="height:2.2ex" alt="Babylonian
  numerals 181" /></a>, three sixties and one unit.<a name="NtA_186"
  href="#Nt_186"><sup>[186]</sup></a> The main <!-- Page 52 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page52"></a>[52]</span>use of this Babylonian
  symbol seems to have been in the fractions, 60ths, 3600ths, etc., and
  somewhat similar to the Greek use of <span title="o" class="grk"
  >&omicron;</span>, for <span title="ouden" class="grk"
  >&omicron;&#x1F50;&delta;&#x1F73;&nu;</span>, with the meaning
  <i>vacant</i>.</p>

  <p>"The earliest undoubted occurrence of a zero in India is an
  inscription at Gwalior, dated Samvat 933 (876 <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span>). Where 50 garlands are mentioned (line 20), 50
  is written <a href="images/058a.png"><img src="images/058a.png"
  class="middle" style="height:2ex" alt="Gwalior numerals 50" /></a>. 270
  (line 4) is written <a href="images/058b.png"><img src="images/058b.png"
  class="middle" style="height:2ex" alt="Gwalior numerals 270" /></a>."<a
  name="NtA_187" href="#Nt_187"><sup>[187]</sup></a> The <span
  class="special" title="Bakhsali">Bakh&#x1E63;&#x101;l&#x12B;</span>
  Manuscript<a name="NtA_188" href="#Nt_188"><sup>[188]</sup></a> probably
  antedates this, using the point or dot as a zero symbol. Bayley mentions
  a grant of Jaika Rashtrakúta of Bharuj, found at Okamandel, of date 738
  <span class="scac">A.D.</span>, which contains a zero, and also a coin
  with indistinct Gupta date 707 (897 <span class="scac">A.D.</span>), but
  the reliability of Bayley's work is questioned. As has been noted, the
  appearance of the numerals in inscriptions and on coins would be of much
  later occurrence than the origin and written exposition of the system.
  From the period mentioned the spread was rapid over all of India, save
  the southern part, where the Tamil and Malayalam people retain the old
  system even to the present day.<a name="NtA_189"
  href="#Nt_189"><sup>[189]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Aside from its appearance in early inscriptions, there is still
  another indication of the Hindu origin of the symbol in the special
  treatment of the concept zero in the early works on arithmetic.
  Brahmagupta, who lived in Ujjain, the center of Indian astronomy,<a
  name="NtA_190" href="#Nt_190"><sup>[190]</sup></a> in the early part <!--
  Page 53 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page53"></a>[53]</span>of the
  seventh century, gives in his arithmetic<a name="NtA_191"
  href="#Nt_191"><sup>[191]</sup></a> a distinct treatment of the
  properties of zero. He does not discuss a symbol, but he shows by his
  treatment that in some way zero had acquired a special significance not
  found in the Greek or other ancient arithmetics. A still more scientific
  treatment is given by Bh&#x101;skara,<a name="NtA_192"
  href="#Nt_192"><sup>[192]</sup></a> although in one place he permits
  himself an unallowed liberty in dividing by zero. The most recently
  discovered work of ancient Indian mathematical lore, the <span
  class="special"
  title="Ganita-Sara-Sangraha">Ganita-S&#x101;ra-Sa&#x1E45;graha</span><a
  name="NtA_193" href="#Nt_193"><sup>[193]</sup></a> of
  Mah&#x101;v&#x12B;r&#x101;c&#x101;rya (c. 830 <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span>), while it does not use the numerals with place
  value, has a similar discussion of the calculation with zero.</p>

  <p>What suggested the form for the zero is, of course, purely a matter of
  conjecture. The dot, which the Hindus used to fill up lacunæ in their
  manuscripts, much as we indicate a break in a sentence,<a name="NtA_194"
  href="#Nt_194"><sup>[194]</sup></a> would have been a more natural
  symbol; and this is the one which the Hindus first used<a name="NtA_195"
  href="#Nt_195"><sup>[195]</sup></a> and which most Arabs use to-day.
  There was also used for this purpose a cross, like our X, and this is
  occasionally found as a zero symbol.<a name="NtA_196"
  href="#Nt_196"><sup>[196]</sup></a> In the <span class="special"
  title="Bakhsali">Bakh&#x1E63;&#x101;l&#x12B;</span> manuscript above
  mentioned, the word <i>&#x15B;&#x16B;nya</i>, with the dot as its symbol,
  is used to denote the unknown quantity, as well as to denote zero. An
  analogous use of the <!-- Page 54 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page54"></a>[54]</span>zero, for the unknown quantity in a
  proportion, appears in a Latin manuscript of some lectures by Gottfried
  Wolack in the University of Erfurt in 1467 and 1468.<a name="NtA_197"
  href="#Nt_197"><sup>[197]</sup></a> The usage was noted even as early as
  the eighteenth century.<a name="NtA_198"
  href="#Nt_198"><sup>[198]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The small circle was possibly suggested by the spurred circle which
  was used for ten.<a name="NtA_199" href="#Nt_199"><sup>[199]</sup></a> It
  has also been thought that the omicron used by Ptolemy in his
  <i>Almagest</i>, to mark accidental blanks in the sexagesimal system
  which he employed, may have influenced the Indian writers.<a
  name="NtA_200" href="#Nt_200"><sup>[200]</sup></a> This symbol was used
  quite generally in Europe and Asia, and the Arabic astronomer

  href="#Nt_201"><sup>[201]</sup></a> (died 929 <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span>) used a similar symbol in connection with the
  alphabetic system of numerals. The occasional use by
  Al-Batt&#x101;n&#x12B; of the Arabic negative, <i>l&#x101;</i>, to
  indicate the absence of minutes <!-- Page 55 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page55"></a>[55]</span>(or seconds), is noted by Nallino.<a
  name="NtA_202" href="#Nt_202"><sup>[202]</sup></a> Noteworthy is also the
  use of the <a href="images/061a.png"><img src="images/061a.png"

  &#x15A;&#x101;rad&#x101; characters of the Kashmirian Atharva-Veda, the
  writing being at least 400 years old. Bh&#x101;skara (c. 1150) used a
  small circle above a number to indicate subtraction, and in the Tartar
  writing a redundant word is removed by drawing an oval around it. It
  would be interesting to know whether our score mark <a
  href="images/061b.png"><img src="images/061b.png" class="middle"
  style="height:2.2ex" alt="score mark" /></a>, read "four in the hole,"
  could trace its pedigree to the same sources. O'Creat<a name="NtA_203"
  href="#Nt_203"><sup>[203]</sup></a> (c. 1130), in a letter to his
  teacher, Adelhard of Bath, uses <span title="t" class="grk">&tau;</span>
  for zero, being an abbreviation for the word <i>teca</i> which we shall
  see was one of the names used for zero, although it could quite as well
  be from <span title="tziphra" class="grk"
  >&tau;&zeta;&#x1F77;&phi;&rho;&alpha;</span>. More rarely O'Creat uses <a
  href="images/061c.png"><img src="images/061c.png" class="middle"
  style="height:1.8ex" alt="circle with bar" /></a>, applying the name
  <i>cyfra</i> to both forms. Frater Sigsboto<a name="NtA_204"
  href="#Nt_204"><sup>[204]</sup></a> (c. 1150) uses the same symbol. Other
  peculiar forms are noted by Heiberg<a name="NtA_205"
  href="#Nt_205"><sup>[205]</sup></a> as being in use among the Byzantine
  Greeks in the fifteenth century. It is evident from the text that some of
  these writers did not understand the import of the new system.<a
  name="NtA_206" href="#Nt_206"><sup>[206]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Although the dot was used at first in India, as noted above, the small
  circle later replaced it and continues in use to this day. The Arabs,
  however, did not adopt the <!-- Page 56 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page56"></a>[56]</span>circle, since it bore some resemblance to
  the letter which expressed the number five in the alphabet system.<a
  name="NtA_207" href="#Nt_207"><sup>[207]</sup></a> The earliest Arabic
  zero known is the dot, used in a manuscript of 873 <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span><a name="NtA_208"
  href="#Nt_208"><sup>[208]</sup></a> Sometimes both the dot and the circle
  are used in the same work, having the same meaning, which is the case in
  an Arabic MS., an abridged arithmetic of Jamshid,<a name="NtA_209"
  href="#Nt_209"><sup>[209]</sup></a> 982 A.H. (1575 <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span>). As given in this work the numerals are <a
  href="images/062a.png"><img src="images/062a.png" class="middle"
  style="height:2.8ex" alt="symbols" /></a>. The form for 5 varies, in some
  works becoming <a href="images/062b.png"><img src="images/062b.png"
  class="middle" style="height:2ex" alt="symbol" /></a> or <a
  href="images/062c.png"><img src="images/062c.png" class="middle"

  src="images/062e.png" class="middle" style="height:2ex" alt="symbol"
  /></a> appears in some fonts of type. To-day the Arabs use the 0 only
  when, under European influence, they adopt the ordinary system. Among the
  Chinese the first definite trace of zero is in the work of Tsin<a
  name="NtA_210" href="#Nt_210"><sup>[210]</sup></a> of 1247 <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> The form is the circular one of the Hindus, and
  undoubtedly was brought to China by some traveler.</p>

  <p>The name of this all-important symbol also demands some attention,
  especially as we are even yet quite undecided as to what to call it. We
  speak of it to-day as <i>zero, naught</i>, and even <i>cipher</i>; the
  telephone operator often calls it <i>O</i>, and the illiterate or
  careless person calls it <i>aught</i>. In view of all this uncertainty we
  may well inquire what it has been called in the past.<a name="NtA_211"
  href="#Nt_211"><sup>[211]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 57 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page57"></a>[57]</span></p>

  <p>As already stated, the Hindus called it <i>&#x15B;&#x16B;nya</i>,
  "void."<a name="NtA_212" href="#Nt_212"><sup>[212]</sup></a> This passed
  over into the Arabic as <i><span class="special"

  (1330), writing under both the Greek and the Arabic influence, called it
  <i>tziphra</i>.<a name="NtA_215" href="#Nt_215"><sup>[215]</sup></a> In a
  treatise on arithmetic written in the Italian language by Jacob of
  Florence<a name="NtA_216" href="#Nt_216"><sup>[216]</sup></a> <!-- Page

  called <i>zeuero</i>,<a name="NtA_217"
  href="#Nt_217"><sup>[217]</sup></a> while in an arithmetic of Giovanni di
  Danti of Arezzo (1370) the word appears as <i>çeuero</i>.<a

  <i>zepiro</i>,<a name="NtA_219" href="#Nt_219"><sup>[219]</sup></a> which
  was also a step from <i>zephirum</i> to zero.<a name="NtA_220"
  href="#Nt_220"><sup>[220]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Of course the English <i>cipher</i>, French <i>chiffre</i>, is derived
  from the same Arabic word, <i><span class="special"
  title="as-sifr">a&#x1E63;-&#x1E63;ifr</span></i>, but in several
  languages it has come to mean the numeral figures in general. A trace of
  this appears in our word <i>ciphering</i>, meaning figuring or
  computing.<a name="NtA_221" href="#Nt_221"><sup>[221]</sup></a> Johann
  Huswirt<a name="NtA_222" href="#Nt_222"><sup>[222]</sup></a> uses the
  word with both meanings; he gives for the tenth character the four names
  <i>theca, circulus, cifra</i>, and <i>figura nihili</i>. In this
  statement Huswirt probably follows, as did many writers of that period,
  the <i>Algorismus</i> of Johannes de Sacrobosco (c. 1250 <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span>), who was also known as John of Halifax or John
  of Holywood. The commentary of <!-- Page 59 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  href="#Nt_223"><sup>[223]</sup></a> (c. 1291 <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span>) on the <i>Algorismus vulgaris</i> of Sacrobosco
  was also widely used. The widespread use of this Englishman's work on
  arithmetic in the universities of that time is attested by the large
  number<a name="NtA_224" href="#Nt_224"><sup>[224]</sup></a> of MSS. from
  the thirteenth to the seventeenth century still extant, twenty in Munich,
  twelve in Vienna, thirteen in Erfurt, several in England given by

  the Plimpton collection,<a name="NtA_226"

  Library, and, of course, many others.</p>

  <p>From <i><span class="special"
  title="as-sifr">a&#x1E63;-&#x1E63;ifr</span> </i>has come <i>zephyr,
  cipher,</i> and finally the abridged form <i>zero</i>. The earliest
  printed work in which is found this final form appears to be Calandri's
  arithmetic of 1491,<a name="NtA_227" href="#Nt_227"><sup>[227]</sup></a>

<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>

<p class="cenhead">THE QUESTION OF THE INTRODUCTION OF THE
NUMERALS INTO EUROPE BY BOETHIUS</p>

  <p>Just as we were quite uncertain as to the origin of the numeral forms,
  so too are we uncertain as to the time and place of their introduction
  into Europe. There are two general theories as to this introduction. The
  first is that they were carried by the Moors to Spain in the eighth or
  ninth century, and thence were transmitted to Christian Europe, a theory
  which will be considered later. The second, advanced by Woepcke,<a
  name="NtA_247" href="#Nt_247"><sup>[247]</sup></a> is that they were not
  brought to Spain by the Moors, but that they were already in Spain when
  the Arabs arrived there, having reached the West through the
  Neo-Pythagoreans. There are two facts to support this second theory: (1)
  the forms of these numerals are characteristic, differing materially from
  those which were brought by Leonardo of Pisa from Northern Africa early
  in the thirteenth century (before 1202 <span class="scac">A.D.</span>);
  (2) they are essentially those which <!-- Page 64 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page64"></a>[64]</span>tradition has so
  persistently assigned to Boethius (c. 500 <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span>), and which he would naturally have received, if
  at all, from these same Neo-Pythagoreans or from the sources from which
  they derived them. Furthermore, Woepcke points out that the Arabs on
  entering Spain (711 <span class="scac">A.D.</span>) would naturally have
  followed their custom of adopting for the computation of taxes the
  numerical systems of the countries they conquered,<a name="NtA_248"
  href="#Nt_248"><sup>[248]</sup></a> so that the numerals brought from
  Spain to Italy, not having undergone the same modifications as those of
  the Eastern Arab empire, would have differed, as they certainly did, from
  those that came through Bagdad. The theory is that the Hindu system,
  without the zero, early reached Alexandria (say 450 <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span>), and that the Neo-Pythagorean love for the
  mysterious and especially for the Oriental led to its use as something
  bizarre and cabalistic; that it was then passed along the Mediterranean,
  reaching Boethius in Athens or in Rome, and to the schools of Spain,
  being discovered in Africa and Spain by the Arabs even before they
  themselves knew the improved system with the place value.</p>

<p><!-- Page 65 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page65"></a>[65]</span></p>

  <p>A recent theory set forth by Bubnov<a name="NtA_249"
  href="#Nt_249"><sup>[249]</sup></a> also deserves mention, chiefly
  because of the seriousness of purpose shown by this well-known writer.
  Bubnov holds that the forms first found in Europe are derived from
  ancient symbols used on the abacus, but that the zero is of Hindu origin.
  This theory does not seem tenable, however, in the light of the evidence
  already set forth.</p>

  <p>Two questions are presented by Woepcke's theory: (1) What was the
  nature of these Spanish numerals, and how were they made known to Italy?
  (2) Did Boethius know them?</p>

  <p>The Spanish forms of the numerals were called the <i><span
  class="special" title="huruf al-gobar">&#x1E25;ur&#x16B;f
  al-&#x121;ob&#x101;r</span></i>, the &#x121;ob&#x101;r or dust numerals,
  as distinguished from the <i><span class="special" title="huruf al-jumal"
  >&#x1E25;ur&#x16B;f al-jumal</span></i> or alphabetic numerals. Probably
  the latter, under the influence of the Syrians or Jews,<a name="NtA_250"
  href="#Nt_250"><sup>[250]</sup></a> were also used by the Arabs. The
  significance of the term &#x121;ob&#x101;r is doubtless that these
  numerals were written on the dust abacus, this plan being distinct from
  the counter method of representing numbers. It is also worthy of note
  that Al-B&#x12B;r&#x16B;n&#x12B; states that the Hindus often performed
  numerical computations in the sand. The term is found as early as c. 950,
  in the verses of an anonymous writer of Kairw&#x101;n, in Tunis, in which
  the author speaks of one of his works on &#x121;ob&#x101;r calculation;<a
  name="NtA_251" href="#Nt_251"><sup>[251]</sup></a> and, much later, the
  Arab writer <span class="special" title="Abu Bekr Mohammed ibn `Abdallah"
  >Ab&#x16B; Bekr Mo&#x1E25;ammed ibn &#x201B;Abdall&#x101;h</span>,
  surnamed <span class="special"
  title="al-Hassar">al-&#x1E24;a&#x1E63;&#x1E63;&#x101;r</span> <!-- Page
  66 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page66"></a>[66]</span>(the
  arithmetician), wrote a work of which the second chapter was "On the dust
  figures."<a name="NtA_252" href="#Nt_252"><sup>[252]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The &#x121;ob&#x101;r numerals themselves were first made known to
  modern scholars by Silvestre de Sacy, who discovered them in an Arabic
  manuscript from the library of the ancient abbey of
  St.-Germain-des-Prés.<a name="NtA_253"
  href="#Nt_253"><sup>[253]</sup></a> The system has nine characters, but
  no zero. A dot above a character indicates tens, two dots hundreds, and
  so on, <a href="images/072a.png"><img src="images/072a.png"
  class="middle" style="height:2ex" alt="5 with dot" /></a> meaning 50, and
  <a href="images/072b.png"><img src="images/072b.png" class="middle"
  style="height:2ex" alt="5 with 3 dots" /></a> meaning 5000. It has been
  suggested that possibly these dots, sprinkled like dust above the
  numerals, gave rise to the word <i>&#x121;ob&#x101;r</i>,<a
  name="NtA_254" href="#Nt_254"><sup>[254]</sup></a> but this is not at all
  probable. This system of dots is found in Persia at a much later date
  with numerals quite like the modern Arabic;<a name="NtA_255"
  href="#Nt_255"><sup>[255]</sup></a> but that it was used at all is
  significant, for it is hardly likely that the western system would go
  back to Persia, when the perfected Hindu one was near at hand.</p>

  <p>At first sight there would seem to be some reason for believing that
  this feature of the &#x121;ob&#x101;r system was of <!-- Page 67 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page67"></a>[67]</span>Arabic origin, and that
  the present zero of these people,<a name="NtA_256"
  href="#Nt_256"><sup>[256]</sup></a> the dot, was derived from it. It was
  entirely natural that the Semitic people generally should have adopted
  such a scheme, since their diacritical marks would suggest it, not to
  speak of the possible influence of the Greek accents in the Hellenic
  number system. When we consider, however, that the dot is found for zero
  in the <span class="special"
  title="Bakhsali">Bakh&#x1E63;&#x101;l&#x12B;</span> manuscript,<a
  name="NtA_257" href="#Nt_257"><sup>[257]</sup></a> and that it was used
  in subscript form in the <i>Kit&#x101;b al-Fihrist</i><a name="NtA_258"
  href="#Nt_258"><sup>[258]</sup></a> in the tenth century, and as late as
  the sixteenth century,<a name="NtA_259"
  href="#Nt_259"><sup>[259]</sup></a> although in this case probably under
  Arabic influence, we are forced to believe that this form may also have
  been of Hindu origin.</p>

  <p>The fact seems to be that, as already stated,<a name="NtA_260"
  href="#Nt_260"><sup>[260]</sup></a> the Arabs did not immediately adopt
  the Hindu zero, because it resembled their 5; they used the superscript
  dot as serving their purposes fairly well; they may, indeed, have carried
  this to the west and have added it to the &#x121;ob&#x101;r forms already
  there, just as they transmitted it to the Persians. Furthermore, the Arab
  and Hebrew scholars of Northern Africa in the tenth century knew these
  numerals as Indian forms, for a commentary on the <i><span
  class="special" title="Sefer Yesirah">S&#x113;fer
  Ye&#x1E63;&#x12B;r&#x101;h</span></i> by Ab&#x16B; Sahl ibn Tamim
  (probably composed at Kairw&#x101;n, c. 950) speaks of "the Indian
  arithmetic known under the name of <i>&#x121;ob&#x101;r</i> or dust
  calculation."<a name="NtA_261" href="#Nt_261"><sup>[261]</sup></a> All
  this suggests that the Arabs may very <!-- Page 68 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page68"></a>[68]</span>likely have known the
  &#x121;ob&#x101;r forms before the numerals reached them again in 773.<a
  name="NtA_262" href="#Nt_262"><sup>[262]</sup></a> The term
  "&#x121;ob&#x101;r numerals" was also used without any reference to the
  peculiar use of dots.<a name="NtA_263"
  href="#Nt_263"><sup>[263]</sup></a> In this connection it is worthy of
  mention that the Algerians employed two different forms of numerals in
  manuscripts even of the fourteenth century,<a name="NtA_264"
  href="#Nt_264"><sup>[264]</sup></a> and that the Moroccans of to-day
  employ the European forms instead of the present Arabic.</p>

  <p>The Indian use of subscript dots to indicate the tens, hundreds,
  thousands, etc., is established by a passage in the <i>Kit&#x101;b
  al-Fihrist</i><a name="NtA_265" href="#Nt_265"><sup>[265]</sup></a> (987
  <span class="scac">A.D.</span>) in which the writer discusses the written
  language of the people of India. Notwithstanding the importance of this
  reference for the early history of the numerals, it has not been
  mentioned by previous writers on this subject. The numeral forms given
  are those which have usually been called Indian,<a name="NtA_266"
  href="#Nt_266"><sup>[266]</sup></a> in opposition to &#x121;ob&#x101;r.
  In this document the dots are placed below the characters, instead of
  being superposed as described above. The significance was the same.</p>

  <p>In form these &#x121;ob&#x101;r numerals resemble our own much more
  closely than the Arab numerals do. They varied more or less, but were
  substantially as follows:</p>

<p><!-- Page 69 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page69"></a>[69]</span></p>

  <p>The question of the possible influence of the Egyptian demotic and
  hieratic ordinal forms has been so often suggested that it seems well to
  introduce them at this point, for comparison with the &#x121;ob&#x101;r
  forms. They would as appropriately be used in connection with the Hindu
  forms, and the evidence of a relation of the first three with all these
  systems is apparent. The only further resemblance is in the Demotic 4 and
  in the 9, so that the statement that the Hindu forms in general came from
  <!-- Page 70 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page70"></a>[70]</span>this source has no foundation. The first
  four Egyptian cardinal numerals<a name="NtA_272"
  href="#Nt_272"><sup>[272]</sup></a> resemble more the modern Arabic.</p>

    <span class="sc">Demotic and Hieratic Ordinals</span>
  </div>
  <p>This theory of the very early introduction of the numerals into Europe
  fails in several points. In the first place the early Western forms are
  not known; in the second place some early Eastern forms are like the
  &#x121;ob&#x101;r, as is seen in the third line on p. <a
  href="#page69">69</a>, where the forms are from a manuscript written at
  Shiraz about 970 <span class="scac">A.D.</span>, and in which some
  western Arabic forms, e.g. <a href="images/076b.png"><img
  src="images/076b.png" class="middle" style="height:2ex" alt="symbol"
  /></a> for 2, are also used. Probably most significant of all is the fact
  that the &#x121;ob&#x101;r numerals as given by Sacy are all, with the
  exception of the symbol for eight, either single Arabic letters or
  combinations of letters. So much for the Woepcke theory and the meaning
  of the &#x121;ob&#x101;r numerals. We now have to consider the question
  as to whether Boethius knew these &#x121;ob&#x101;r forms, or forms akin
  to them.</p>

  <p>This large question<a name="NtA_273"
  href="#Nt_273"><sup>[273]</sup></a> suggests several minor ones: (1) Who
  was Boethius? (2) Could he have known these numerals? (3) Is there any
  positive or strong circumstantial evidence that he did know them? (4)
  What are the probabilities in the case?</p>

<p><!-- Page 71 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page71"></a>[71]</span></p>

  <p>First, who was Boethius,&mdash;Divus<a name="NtA_274"
  href="#Nt_274"><sup>[274]</sup></a> Boethius as he was called in the
  Middle Ages? Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius<a name="NtA_275"
  href="#Nt_275"><sup>[275]</sup></a> was born at Rome c. 475. He was a
  member of the distinguished family of the Anicii,<a name="NtA_276"
  href="#Nt_276"><sup>[276]</sup></a> which had for some time before his
  birth been Christian. Early left an orphan, the tradition is that he was
  taken to Athens at about the age of ten, and that he remained there
  eighteen years.<a name="NtA_277" href="#Nt_277"><sup>[277]</sup></a> He
  married Rusticiana, daughter of the senator Symmachus, and this union of
  two such powerful families allowed him to move in the highest circles.<a
  name="NtA_278" href="#Nt_278"><sup>[278]</sup></a> Standing strictly for
  the right, and against all iniquity at court, he became the object of
  hatred on the part of all the unscrupulous element near the throne, and
  his bold defense of the ex-consul Albinus, unjustly accused of treason,
  led to his imprisonment at Pavia<a name="NtA_279"
  href="#Nt_279"><sup>[279]</sup></a> and his execution in 524.<a
  name="NtA_280" href="#Nt_280"><sup>[280]</sup></a> Not many generations
  after his death, the period being one in which historical criticism was
  at its lowest ebb, the church found it profitable to look upon his
  execution as a martyrdom.<a name="NtA_281"
  href="#Nt_281"><sup>[281]</sup></a> He was <!-- Page 72 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page72"></a>[72]</span>accordingly looked upon
  as a saint,<a name="NtA_282" href="#Nt_282"><sup>[282]</sup></a> his
  bones were enshrined,<a name="NtA_283"
  href="#Nt_283"><sup>[283]</sup></a> and as a natural consequence his
  books were among the classics in the church schools for a thousand
  years.<a name="NtA_284" href="#Nt_284"><sup>[284]</sup></a> It is
  pathetic, however, to think of the medieval student trying to extract
  mental nourishment from a work so abstract, so meaningless, so
  unnecessarily complicated, as the arithmetic of Boethius.</p>

  <p>He was looked upon by his contemporaries and immediate successors as a
  master, for Cassiodorus<a name="NtA_285"
  href="#Nt_285"><sup>[285]</sup></a> (c. 490-c. 585 <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span>) says to him: "Through your translations the
  music of Pythagoras and the astronomy of Ptolemy are read by those of
  Italy, and the arithmetic of Nicomachus and the geometry of Euclid are
  known to those of the West."<a name="NtA_286"
  href="#Nt_286"><sup>[286]</sup></a> Founder of the medieval
  scholasticism, <!-- Page 73 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page73"></a>[73]</span>distinguishing the trivium and quadrivium,<a
  name="NtA_287" href="#Nt_287"><sup>[287]</sup></a> writing the only
  classics of his time, Gibbon well called him "the last of the Romans whom
  Cato or Tully could have acknowledged for their countryman."<a
  name="NtA_288" href="#Nt_288"><sup>[288]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The second question relating to Boethius is this: Could he possibly
  have known the Hindu numerals? In view of the relations that will be
  shown to have existed between the East and the West, there can only be an
  affirmative answer to this question. The numerals had existed, without
  the zero, for several centuries; they had been well known in India; there
  had been a continued interchange of thought between the East and West;
  and warriors, ambassadors, scholars, and the restless trader, all had
  gone back and forth, by land or more frequently by sea, between the
  Mediterranean lands and the centers of Indian commerce and culture.
  Boethius could very well have learned one or more forms of Hindu numerals
  from some traveler or merchant.</p>

  <p>To justify this statement it is necessary to speak more fully of these
  relations between the Far East and Europe. It is true that we have no
  records of the interchange of learning, in any large way, between eastern
  Asia and central Europe in the century preceding the time of Boethius.
  But it is one of the mistakes of scholars to believe that they are the
  sole transmitters of knowledge. <!-- Page 74 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page74"></a>[74]</span>As a matter of fact there is abundant reason
  for believing that Hindu numerals would naturally have been known to the
  Arabs, and even along every trade route to the remote west, long before
  the zero entered to make their place-value possible, and that the
  characters, the methods of calculating, the improvements that took place
  from time to time, the zero when it appeared, and the customs as to
  solving business problems, would all have been made known from generation
  to generation along these same trade routes from the Orient to the
  Occident. It must always be kept in mind that it was to the tradesman and
  the wandering scholar that the spread of such learning was due, rather
  than to the school man. Indeed, Avicenna<a name="NtA_289"
  href="#Nt_289"><sup>[289]</sup></a> (980-1037 <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span>) in a short biography of himself relates that
  when his people were living at Bokh&#x101;ra his father sent him to the
  house of a grocer to learn the Hindu art of reckoning, in which this
  grocer (oil dealer, possibly) was expert. Leonardo of Pisa, too, had a
  similar training.</p>

  <p>The whole question of this spread of mercantile knowledge along the
  trade routes is so connected with the &#x121;ob&#x101;r numerals, the
  Boethius question, Gerbert, Leonardo of Pisa, and other names and events,
  that a digression for its consideration now becomes necessary.<a
  name="NtA_290" href="#Nt_290"><sup>[290]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 75 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page75"></a>[75]</span></p>

  <p>Even in very remote times, before the Hindu numerals were sculptured
  in the cave of N&#x101;n&#x101; Gh&#x101;t, there were trade relations
  between Arabia and India. Indeed, long before the Aryans went to India
  the great Turanian race had spread its civilization from the
  Mediterranean to the Indus.<a name="NtA_291"
  href="#Nt_291"><sup>[291]</sup></a> At a much later period the Arabs were
  the intermediaries between Egypt and Syria on the west, and the farther
  Orient.<a name="NtA_292" href="#Nt_292"><sup>[292]</sup></a> In the sixth
  century <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, Hecatæus,<a name="NtA_293"
  href="#Nt_293"><sup>[293]</sup></a> the father of geography, was
  acquainted not only with the Mediterranean lands but with the countries
  as far as the Indus,<a name="NtA_294" href="#Nt_294"><sup>[294]</sup></a>
  and in Biblical times there were regular triennial voyages to India.
  Indeed, the story of Joseph bears witness to the caravan trade from
  India, across Arabia, and on to the banks of the Nile. About the same
  time as Hecatæus, Scylax, a Persian admiral under Darius, from Caryanda
  on the coast of Asia Minor, traveled to <!-- Page 76 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page76"></a>[76]</span>northwest India and wrote
  upon his ventures.<a name="NtA_295" href="#Nt_295"><sup>[295]</sup></a>
  He induced the nations along the Indus to acknowledge the Persian
  supremacy, and such number systems as there were in these lands would
  naturally have been known to a man of his attainments.</p>

  <p>A century after Scylax, Herodotus showed considerable knowledge of
  India, speaking of its cotton and its gold,<a name="NtA_296"
  href="#Nt_296"><sup>[296]</sup></a> telling how Sesostris<a
  name="NtA_297" href="#Nt_297"><sup>[297]</sup></a> fitted out ships to
  sail to that country, and mentioning the routes to the east. These routes
  were generally by the Red Sea, and had been followed by the
  Ph&oelig;nicians and the Sabæans, and later were taken by the Greeks and
  Romans.<a name="NtA_298" href="#Nt_298"><sup>[298]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In the fourth century <span class="scac">B.C.</span> the West and East
  came into very close relations. As early as 330, Pytheas of Massilia
  (Marseilles) had explored as far north as the northern end of the British
  Isles and the coasts of the German Sea, while Macedon, in close touch
  with southern France, was also sending her armies under Alexander<a
  name="NtA_299" href="#Nt_299"><sup>[299]</sup></a> through Afghanistan as
  far east as the Punjab.<a name="NtA_300"
  href="#Nt_300"><sup>[300]</sup></a> Pliny tells us that Alexander the
  Great employed surveyors to measure <!-- Page 77 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page77"></a>[77]</span>the roads of India; and
  one of the great highways is described by Megasthenes, who in 295 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>, as the ambassador of Seleucus, resided at <span
  class="special"
  title="Pataliputra">P&#x101;tal&#x12B;pu&#x1E6D;ra</span>, the present
  Patna.<a name="NtA_301" href="#Nt_301"><sup>[301]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The Hindus also learned the art of coining from the Greeks, or
  possibly from the Chinese, and the stores of Greco-Hindu coins still
  found in northern India are a constant source of historical
  information.<a name="NtA_302" href="#Nt_302"><sup>[302]</sup></a> The
  R&#x101;m&#x101;yana speaks of merchants traveling in great caravans and
  embarking by sea for foreign lands.<a name="NtA_303"
  href="#Nt_303"><sup>[303]</sup></a> Ceylon traded with Malacca and Siam,
  and Java was colonized by Hindu traders, so that mercantile knowledge was
  being spread about the Indies during all the formative period of the
  numerals.</p>

  <p>Moreover the results of the early Greek invasion were embodied by
  Dicæarchus of Messana (about 320 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>) in a map
  that long remained a standard. Furthermore, Alexander did not allow his
  influence on the East to cease. He divided India into three satrapies,<a
  name="NtA_304" href="#Nt_304"><sup>[304]</sup></a> placing Greek
  governors over two of them and leaving a Hindu ruler in charge of the
  third, and in Bactriana, a part of Ariana or ancient Persia, he left
  governors; and in these the western civilization was long in evidence.
  Some of the Greek and Roman metrical and astronomical terms <!-- Page 78
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page78"></a>[78]</span>found their way,
  doubtless at this time, into the Sanskrit language.<a name="NtA_305"
  href="#Nt_305"><sup>[305]</sup></a> Even as late as from the second to
  the fifth centuries <span class="scac">A.D.</span>, Indian coins showed
  the Hellenic influence. The Hindu astronomical terminology reveals the
  same relationship to western thought, for Var&#x101;ha-Mihira (6th
  century <span class="scac">A.D.</span>), a contemporary of <span
  class="special" title="Aryabhata">&#x100;ryabha&#x1E6D;a</span>, entitled
  a work of his the <i><span class="special"
  title="Brhat-Samhita">B&#x1E5B;hat-Sa&#x1E43;hit&#x101;</span></i>, a
  literal translation of <span title="megalê suntaxis" class="grk"
  >&mu;&epsilon;&gamma;&#x1F71;&lambda;&eta;
  &sigma;&#x1F7B;&nu;&tau;&alpha;&xi;&iota;&sigmaf;</span> of Ptolemy;<a
  name="NtA_306" href="#Nt_306"><sup>[306]</sup></a> and in various ways is
  this interchange of ideas apparent.<a name="NtA_307"
  href="#Nt_307"><sup>[307]</sup></a> It could not have been at all unusual
  for the ancient Greeks to go to India, for Strabo lays down the route,
  saying that all who make the journey start from Ephesus and traverse
  Phrygia and Cappadocia before taking the direct road.<a name="NtA_308"
  href="#Nt_308"><sup>[308]</sup></a> The products of the East were always
  finding their way to the West, the Greeks getting their ginger<a
  name="NtA_309" href="#Nt_309"><sup>[309]</sup></a> from Malabar, as the
  Ph&oelig;nicians had long before brought gold from Malacca.</p>

  <p>Greece must also have had early relations with China, for there is a
  notable similarity between the Greek and Chinese life, as is shown in
  their houses, their domestic customs, their marriage ceremonies, the
  public story-tellers, the puppet shows which Herodotus says were
  introduced from Egypt, the street jugglers, the games of dice,<a
  name="NtA_310" href="#Nt_310"><sup>[310]</sup></a> the game of
  finger-guessing,<a name="NtA_311" href="#Nt_311"><sup>[311]</sup></a> the
  water clock, the <!-- Page 79 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page79"></a>[79]</span>music system, the use of the myriad,<a
  name="NtA_312" href="#Nt_312"><sup>[312]</sup></a> the calendars, and in
  many other ways.<a name="NtA_313" href="#Nt_313"><sup>[313]</sup></a> In
  passing through the suburbs of Peking to-day, on the way to the Great
  Bell temple, one is constantly reminded of the semi-Greek architecture of
  Pompeii, so closely does modern China touch the old classical
  civilization of the Mediterranean. The Chinese historians tell us that
  about 200 <span class="scac">B.C.</span> their arms were successful in
  the far west, and that in 180 <span class="scac">B.C.</span> an
  ambassador went to Bactria, then a Greek city, and reported that Chinese
  products were on sale in the markets there.<a name="NtA_314"
  href="#Nt_314"><sup>[314]</sup></a> There is also a noteworthy
  resemblance between certain Greek and Chinese words,<a name="NtA_315"
  href="#Nt_315"><sup>[315]</sup></a> showing that in remote times there
  must have been more or less interchange of thought.</p>

  <p>The Romans also exchanged products with the East. Horace says, "A busy
  trader, you hasten to the farthest Indies, flying from poverty over sea,
  over crags, over fires."<a name="NtA_316"
  href="#Nt_316"><sup>[316]</sup></a> The products of the Orient, spices
  and jewels from India, frankincense from Persia, and silks from China,
  being more in demand than the exports from the Mediterranean lands, the
  balance of trade was against the West, and thus Roman coin found its way
  eastward. In 1898, for example, a number of Roman coins dating from 114
  <span class="scac">B.C.</span> to Hadrian's time were found at
  Pakl&#x12B;, a part of the Haz&#x101;ra district, sixteen miles north of
  Abbott&#x101;b&#x101;d,<a name="NtA_317"
  href="#Nt_317"><sup>[317]</sup></a> and numerous similar discoveries have
  been made from time to time.</p>

<p><!-- Page 80 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page80"></a>[80]</span></p>

  <p>Augustus speaks of envoys received by him from India, a thing never
  before known,<a name="NtA_318" href="#Nt_318"><sup>[318]</sup></a> and it
  is not improbable that he also received an embassy from China.<a
  name="NtA_319" href="#Nt_319"><sup>[319]</sup></a> Suetonius (first
  century <span class="scac">A.D.</span>) speaks in his history of these
  relations,<a name="NtA_320" href="#Nt_320"><sup>[320]</sup></a> as do
  several of his contemporaries,<a name="NtA_321"
  href="#Nt_321"><sup>[321]</sup></a> and Vergil<a name="NtA_322"
  href="#Nt_322"><sup>[322]</sup></a> tells of Augustus doing battle in
  Persia. In Pliny's time the trade of the Roman Empire with Asia amounted
  to a million and a quarter dollars a year, a sum far greater relatively
  then than now,<a name="NtA_323" href="#Nt_323"><sup>[323]</sup></a> while
  by the time of Constantine Europe was in direct communication with the
  Far East.<a name="NtA_324" href="#Nt_324"><sup>[324]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In view of these relations it is not beyond the range of possibility
  that proof may sometime come to light to show that the Greeks and Romans
  knew something of the <!-- Page 81 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page81"></a>[81]</span>number system of India, as several writers
  have maintained.<a name="NtA_325" href="#Nt_325"><sup>[325]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Returning to the East, there are many evidences of the spread of
  knowledge in and about India itself. In the third century <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span> Buddhism began to be a connecting medium of
  thought. It had already permeated the Himalaya territory, had reached
  eastern Turkestan, and had probably gone thence to China. Some centuries
  later (in 62 <span class="scac">A.D.</span>) the Chinese emperor sent an
  ambassador to India, and in 67 <span class="scac">A.D.</span> a Buddhist
  monk was invited to China.<a name="NtA_326"
  href="#Nt_326"><sup>[326]</sup></a> Then, too, in India itself
  A&#x15B;oka, whose name has already been mentioned in this work, extended
  the boundaries of his domains even into Afghanistan, so that it was
  entirely possible for the numerals of the Punjab to have worked their way
  north even at that early date.<a name="NtA_327"
  href="#Nt_327"><sup>[327]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Furthermore, the influence of Persia must not be forgotten in
  considering this transmission of knowledge. In the fifth century the
  Persian medical school at Jondi-Sapur admitted both the Hindu and the
  Greek doctrines, and Firdus&#x12B; tells us that during the brilliant
  reign of <!-- Page 82 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page82"></a>[82]</span>Khosr&#x16B; I,<a name="NtA_328"
  href="#Nt_328"><sup>[328]</sup></a> the golden age of Pahlav&#x12B;
  literature, the Hindu game of chess was introduced into Persia, at a time
  when wars with the Greeks were bringing prestige to the Sassanid
  dynasty.</p>

  <p>Again, not far from the time of Boethius, in the sixth century, the
  Egyptian monk Cosmas, in his earlier years as a trader, made journeys to
  Abyssinia and even to India and Ceylon, receiving the name
  <i>Indicopleustes</i> (the Indian traveler). His map (547 <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span>) shows some knowledge of the earth from the
  Atlantic to India. Such a man would, with hardly a doubt, have observed
  every numeral system used by the people with whom he sojourned,<a
  name="NtA_329" href="#Nt_329"><sup>[329]</sup></a> and whether or not he
  recorded his studies in permanent form he would have transmitted such
  scraps of knowledge by word of mouth.</p>

  <p>As to the Arabs, it is a mistake to feel that their activities began
  with Mohammed. Commerce had always been held in honor by them, and the
  Qoreish<a name="NtA_330" href="#Nt_330"><sup>[330]</sup></a> had annually
  for many generations sent caravans bearing the spices and textiles of
  Yemen to the shores of the Mediterranean. In the fifth century they
  traded by sea with India and even with China, and <span class="special"
  title="Hira">&#x1E24;ira</span> was an emporium for the wares of the
  East,<a name="NtA_331" href="#Nt_331"><sup>[331]</sup></a> so that any
  numeral system of any part of the trading world could hardly have
  remained isolated.</p>

  <p>Long before the warlike activity of the Arabs, Alexandria had become
  the great market-place of the world. From this center caravans traversed
  Arabia to Hadramaut, where they met ships from India. Others went north
  to Damascus, while still others made their way <!-- Page 83 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page83"></a>[83]</span>along the southern shores
  of the Mediterranean. Ships sailed from the isthmus of Suez to all the
  commercial ports of Southern Europe and up into the Black Sea. Hindus
  were found among the merchants<a name="NtA_332"
  href="#Nt_332"><sup>[332]</sup></a> who frequented the bazaars of
  Alexandria, and Brahmins were reported even in Byzantium.</p>

  <p>Such is a very brief résumé of the evidence showing that the numerals
  of the Punjab and of other parts of India as well, and indeed those of
  China and farther Persia, of Ceylon and the Malay peninsula, might well
  have been known to the merchants of Alexandria, and even to those of any
  other seaport of the Mediterranean, in the time of Boethius. The
  Br&#x101;hm&#x12B; numerals would not have attracted the attention of
  scholars, for they had no zero so far as we know, and therefore they were
  no better and no worse than those of dozens of other systems. If Boethius
  was attracted to them it was probably exactly as any one is naturally
  attracted to the bizarre or the mystic, and he would have mentioned them
  in his works only incidentally, as indeed they are mentioned in the
  manuscripts in which they occur.</p>

  <p>In answer therefore to the second question, Could Boethius have known
  the Hindu numerals? the reply must be, without the slightest doubt, that
  he could easily have known them, and that it would have been strange if a
  man of his inquiring mind did not pick up many curious bits of
  information of this kind even though he never thought of making use of
  them.</p>

  <p>Let us now consider the third question, Is there any positive or
  strong circumstantial evidence that Boethius did know these numerals? The
  question is not new, <!-- Page 84 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page84"></a>[84]</span>nor is it much nearer being answered than it
  was over two centuries ago when Wallis (1693) expressed his doubts about
  it<a name="NtA_333" href="#Nt_333"><sup>[333]</sup></a> soon after
  Vossius (1658) had called attention to the matter.<a name="NtA_334"
  href="#Nt_334"><sup>[334]</sup></a> Stated briefly, there are three works
  on mathematics attributed to Boethius:<a name="NtA_335"
  href="#Nt_335"><sup>[335]</sup></a> (1) the arithmetic, (2) a work on
  music, and (3) the geometry.<a name="NtA_336"
  href="#Nt_336"><sup>[336]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The genuineness of the arithmetic and the treatise on music is
  generally recognized, but the geometry, which contains the Hindu numerals
  with the zero, is under suspicion.<a name="NtA_337"
  href="#Nt_337"><sup>[337]</sup></a> There are plenty of supporters of the
  idea that Boethius knew the numerals and included them in this book,<a
  name="NtA_338" href="#Nt_338"><sup>[338]</sup></a> and on the other hand
  there are as many who <!-- Page 85 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page85"></a>[85]</span>feel that the geometry, or at least the part
  mentioning the numerals, is spurious.<a name="NtA_339"
  href="#Nt_339"><sup>[339]</sup></a> The argument of those who deny the
  authenticity of the particular passage in question may briefly be stated
  thus:</p>

  <p>1. The falsification of texts has always been the subject of
  complaint. It was so with the Romans,<a name="NtA_340"
  href="#Nt_340"><sup>[340]</sup></a> it was common in the Middle Ages,<a
  name="NtA_341" href="#Nt_341"><sup>[341]</sup></a> and it is much more
  prevalent <!-- Page 86 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page86"></a>[86]</span>to-day than we commonly think. We have but
  to see how every hymn-book compiler feels himself authorized to change at
  will the classics of our language, and how unknown editors have mutilated
  Shakespeare, to see how much more easy it was for medieval scribes to
  insert or eliminate paragraphs without any protest from critics.<a
  name="NtA_342" href="#Nt_342"><sup>[342]</sup></a></p>

  <p>2. If Boethius had known these numerals he would have mentioned them
  in his arithmetic, but he does not do so.<a name="NtA_343"
  href="#Nt_343"><sup>[343]</sup></a></p>

  <p>3. If he had known them, and had mentioned them in any of his works,
  his contemporaries, disciples, and successors would have known and
  mentioned them. But neither Capella (c. 475)<a name="NtA_344"

  <p>4. The passage in question has all the appearance of an interpolation
  by some scribe. Boethius is speaking of angles, in his work on geometry,
  when the text suddenly changes to a discussion of classes of numbers.<a

  vary in different manuscripts, but in general are about as shown on page
  <a href="#page88">88</a>. They are commonly written with the 9 at the
  left, decreasing to the unit at the right, numerous writers stating that
  this was because they were derived from Semitic sources in which the
  direction of writing is the opposite of our own. This practice continued
  until the sixteenth century.<a name="NtA_350"
  href="#Nt_350"><sup>[350]</sup></a> The writer then leaves the subject
  entirely, using the Roman numerals for the rest of his discussion, a
  proceeding so foreign to the method of Boethius as to be inexplicable on
  the hypothesis of authenticity. Why should such a scholarly writer have
  given them with no mention of their origin or use? Either he would have
  mentioned some historical interest attaching to them, or he would have
  used them in some discussion; he certainly would not have left the
  passage as it is.</p>

  <p>Sir E. Clive Bayley has added<a name="NtA_361"
  href="#Nt_361"><sup>[361]</sup></a> a further reason for believing them
  spurious, namely that the 4 is not of the N&#x101;n&#x101; Gh&#x101;t
  type, but of the Kabul form which the Arabs did not receive until 776;<a
  name="NtA_362" href="#Nt_362"><sup>[362]</sup></a> so that it is not
  likely, even if the characters were known in Europe in the time of
  Boethius, that this particular form was recognized. It is worthy of
  mention, also, that in the six abacus forms from the chief manuscripts as
  given by Friedlein,<a name="NtA_363" href="#Nt_363"><sup>[363]</sup></a>
  each contains some form of zero, which symbol probably originated in
  India about this time or later. It could hardly have reached Europe so
  soon.</p>

  <p>As to the fourth question, Did Boethius probably know the numerals? It
  seems to be a fair conclusion, according to our present evidence, that
  (1) Boethius might very easily have known these numerals without the
  zero, but, (2) there is no reliable evidence that he did know them. And
  just as Boethius might have come in contact with them, so any other
  inquiring mind might have done so either in his time or at any time
  before they definitely appeared in the tenth century. These centuries,
  five in number, represented the darkest of the Dark Ages, and even if
  these numerals were occasionally met and studied, no trace of them would
  be likely to show itself in the <!-- Page 90 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page90"></a>[90]</span>literature of the period, unless by chance
  it should get into the writings of some man like Alcuin. As a matter of
  fact, it was not until the ninth or tenth century that there is any
  tangible evidence of their presence in Christendom. They were probably
  known to merchants here and there, but in their incomplete state they
  were not of sufficient importance to attract any considerable
  attention.</p>

  <p>As a result of this brief survey of the evidence several conclusions
  seem reasonable: (1) commerce, and travel for travel's sake, never died
  out between the East and the West; (2) merchants had every opportunity of
  knowing, and would have been unreasonably stupid if they had not known,
  the elementary number systems of the peoples with whom they were trading,
  but they would not have put this knowledge in permanent written form; (3)
  wandering scholars would have known many and strange things about the
  peoples they met, but they too were not, as a class, writers; (4) there
  is every reason a priori for believing that the &#x121;ob&#x101;r
  numerals would have been known to merchants, and probably to some of the
  wandering scholars, long before the Arabs conquered northern Africa; (5)
  the wonder is not that the Hindu-Arabic numerals were known about 1000
  <span class="scac">A.D.</span>, and that they were the subject of an
  elaborate work in 1202 by Fibonacci, but rather that more extended
  manuscript evidence of their appearance before that time has not been
  found. That they were more or less known early in the Middle Ages,
  certainly to many merchants of Christian Europe, and probably to several
  scholars, but without the zero, is hardly to be doubted. The lack of
  documentary evidence is not at all strange, in view of all of the
  circumstances.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>

<p class="cenhead">THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NUMERALS
AMONG THE ARABS</p>

  <p>If the numerals had their origin in India, as seems most probable,
  when did the Arabs come to know of them? It is customary to say that it
  was due to the influence of Mohammedanism that learning spread through
  Persia and Arabia; and so it was, in part. But learning was already
  respected in these countries long before Mohammed appeared, and commerce
  flourished all through this region. In Persia, for example, the reign of
  Khosr&#x16B; Nu&#x15B;&#x12B;rw&#x101;n,<a name="NtA_364"
  href="#Nt_364"><sup>[364]</sup></a> the great contemporary of Justinian
  the law-maker, was characterized not only by an improvement in social and
  economic conditions, but by the cultivation of letters. Khosr&#x16B;
  fostered learning, inviting to his court scholars from Greece, and
  encouraging the introduction of culture from the West as well as from the
  East. At this time Aristotle and Plato were translated, and portions of
  the <i>Hito-pad&#x113;&#x15B;a</i>, or Fables of Pilpay, were rendered
  from the Sanskrit into Persian. All this means that some three centuries
  before the great intellectual ascendancy of Bagdad a similar fostering of
  learning was taking place in Persia, and under pre-Mohammedan
  influences.</p>

<p><!-- Page 92 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page92"></a>[92]</span></p>

  <p>The first definite trace that we have of the introduction of the Hindu
  system into Arabia dates from 773 <span class="scac">A.D.</span>,<a
  name="NtA_365" href="#Nt_365"><sup>[365]</sup></a> when an Indian
  astronomer visited the court of the caliph, bringing with him
  astronomical tables which at the caliph's command were translated into
  Arabic by Al-Faz&#x101;r&#x12B;.<a name="NtA_366"
  href="#Nt_366"><sup>[366]</sup></a> Al-Khow&#x101;razm&#x12B; and <span
  class="special" title="Habash">&#x1E24;abash</span> (<span
  class="special" title="Ahmed ibn `Abdallah">A&#x1E25;med ibn
  &#x201B;Abdall&#x101;h</span>, died c. 870) based their well-known tables
  upon the work of Al-F&#x101;zar&#x12B;. It may be asserted as highly
  probable that the numerals came at the same time as the tables. They were
  certainly known a few decades later, and before 825 <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span>, about which time the original of the
  <i>Algoritmi de numero Indorum</i> was written, as that work makes no
  pretense of being the first work to treat of the Hindu numerals.</p>

  <p>The three writers mentioned cover the period from the end of the
  eighth to the end of the ninth century. While the historians
  Al-Ma&#x15B;&#x201B;&#x16B;d&#x12B; and Al-B&#x12B;r&#x16B;n&#x12B;
  follow quite closely upon the men mentioned, it is well to note again the
  Arab writers on Hindu arithmetic, contemporary with
  Al-Khow&#x101;razm&#x12B;, who were mentioned in chapter I, viz.
  Al-Kind&#x12B;, Sened ibn &#x201B;Al&#x12B;, and <span class="special"
  title="Al-Sufi">Al-&#x1E62;&#x16B;f&#x12B;</span>.</p>

  <p>For over five hundred years Arabic writers and others continued to
  apply to works on arithmetic the name "Indian." In the tenth century such
  writers are <span class="special" title="`Abdallah ibn al-Hasan"
  >&#x201B;Abdall&#x101;h ibn al-&#x1E24;asan</span>, Ab&#x16B;

  <p>The Greek monk Maximus Planudes, writing in the first half of the
  fourteenth century, followed the Arabic usage in calling his work
  <i>Indian Arithmetic</i>.<a name="NtA_378"
  href="#Nt_378"><sup>[378]</sup></a> There were numerous other Arabic
  writers upon arithmetic, as that subject occupied one of the high places
  among the sciences, but most of them did not feel it necessary to refer
  to the origin of the symbols, the knowledge of which might well have been
  taken for granted.</p>

<p><!-- Page 94 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page94"></a>[94]</span></p>

  <p>One document, cited by Woepcke,<a name="NtA_379"
  href="#Nt_379"><sup>[379]</sup></a> is of special interest since it shows
  at an early period, 970 <span class="scac">A.D.</span>, the use of the
  ordinary Arabic forms alongside the &#x121;ob&#x101;r. The title of the
  work is <i>Interesting and Beautiful Problems on Numbers</i> copied by
  <span class="special" title="Ahmed ibn Mohammed ibn `Abdaljalil"
  >A&#x1E25;med ibn Mo&#x1E25;ammed ibn &#x201B;Abdaljal&#x12B;l</span>,
  Ab&#x16B; Sa&#x201B;&#x12B;d, al-Sijz&#x12B;,<a name="NtA_380"
  href="#Nt_380"><sup>[380]</sup></a> (951-1024) from a work by a priest
  and physician, <span class="special"
  title="Nazif">Na&#x1E93;&#x12B;f</span> ibn Yumn,<a name="NtA_381"
  href="#Nt_381"><sup>[381]</sup></a> al-Qass (died c. 990). Suter does not
  mention this work of <span class="special"
  title="Nazif">Na&#x1E93;&#x12B;f</span>.</p>

  <p>The second reason for not ascribing too much credit to the purely Arab
  influence is that the Arab by himself never showed any intellectual
  strength. What took place after <span class="special"
  title="Mohammed">Mo&#x1E25;ammed</span> had lighted the fire in the
  hearts of his people was just what always takes place when different
  types of strong races blend,&mdash;a great renaissance in divers lines.
  It was seen in the blending of such types at Miletus in the time of
  Thales, at Rome in the days of the early invaders, at Alexandria when the
  Greek set firm foot on Egyptian soil, and we see it now when all the
  nations mingle their vitality in the New World. So when the Arab culture
  joined with the Persian, a new civilization rose and flourished.<a
  name="NtA_382" href="#Nt_382"><sup>[382]</sup></a> The Arab influence
  came not from its purity, but from its intermingling with an influence
  more cultured if less virile.</p>

  <p>As a result of this interactivity among peoples of diverse interests
  and powers, Mohammedanism was to the world from the eighth to the
  thirteenth century what Rome and Athens and the Italo-Hellenic influence
  generally had <!-- Page 95 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page95"></a>[95]</span>been to the ancient civilization. "If they
  did not possess the spirit of invention which distinguished the Greeks
  and the Hindus, if they did not show the perseverance in their
  observations that characterized the Chinese astronomers, they at least
  possessed the virility of a new and victorious people, with a desire to
  understand what others had accomplished, and a taste which led them with
  equal ardor to the study of algebra and of poetry, of philosophy and of
  language."<a name="NtA_383" href="#Nt_383"><sup>[383]</sup></a></p>

  <p>It was in 622 <span class="scac">A.D.</span> that <span
  class="special" title="Mohammed">Mo&#x1E25;ammed</span> fled from Mecca,
  and within a century from that time the crescent had replaced the cross
  in Christian Asia, in Northern Africa, and in a goodly portion of Spain.
  The Arab empire was an ellipse of learning with its foci at Bagdad and
  Cordova, and its rulers not infrequently took pride in demanding
  intellectual rather than commercial treasure as the result of conquest.<a
  name="NtA_384" href="#Nt_384"><sup>[384]</sup></a></p>

  <p>It was under these influences, either pre-Mohammedan or later, that
  the Hindu numerals found their way to the North. If they were known
  before <span class="special" title="Mohammed">Mo&#x1E25;ammed</span>'s
  time, the proof of this fact is now lost. This much, however, is known,
  that in the eighth century they were taken to Bagdad. It was early in
  that century that the Mohammedans obtained their first foothold in
  northern India, thus foreshadowing an epoch of supremacy that endured
  with varied fortunes until after the golden age of Akbar the Great
  (1542-1605) and Shah Jehan. They also conquered Khorassan and
  Afghanistan, so that the learning and the commercial customs of India at
  once found easy <!-- Page 96 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page96"></a>[96]</span>access to the newly-established schools and
  the bazaars of Mesopotamia and western Asia. The particular paths of
  conquest and of commerce were either by way of the Khyber Pass and
  through Kabul, Herat and Khorassan, or by sea through the strait of Ormuz
  to Basra (Busra) at the head of the Persian Gulf, and thence to Bagdad.
  As a matter of fact, one form of Arabic numerals, the one now in use by
  the Arabs, is attributed to the influence of Kabul, while the other,
  which eventually became our numerals, may very likely have reached Arabia
  by the other route. It is in Bagdad,<a name="NtA_385"
  href="#Nt_385"><sup>[385]</sup></a> D&#x101;r al-Sal&#x101;m&mdash;"the
  Abode of Peace," that our special interest in the introduction of the
  numerals centers. Built upon the ruins of an ancient town by <span
  class="special" title="Al-Mansur">Al-Man&#x1E63;&#x16B;r</span><a
  name="NtA_386" href="#Nt_386"><sup>[386]</sup></a> in the second half of
  the eighth century, it lies in one of those regions where the converging
  routes of trade give rise to large cities.<a name="NtA_387"
  href="#Nt_387"><sup>[387]</sup></a> Quite as well of Bagdad as of Athens
  might Cardinal Newman have said:<a name="NtA_388"
  href="#Nt_388"><sup>[388]</sup></a></p>

  <p>"What it lost in conveniences of approach, it gained in its
  neighborhood to the traditions of the mysterious East, and in the
  loveliness of the region in which it lay. Hither, then, as to a sort of
  ideal land, where all archetypes of the great and the fair were found in
  substantial being, and all departments of truth explored, and all
  diversities of intellectual power exhibited, where taste and philosophy
  were majestically enthroned as in a royal court, where there was no
  sovereignty but that of mind, and no nobility but that of genius, where
  professors were <!-- Page 97 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page97"></a>[97]</span>rulers, and princes did homage, thither
  flocked continually from the very corners of the <i>orbis terrarum</i>
  the many-tongued generation, just rising, or just risen into manhood, in
  order to gain wisdom." For here it was that <span class="special"
  title="Al-Mansur">Al-Man&#x1E63;&#x16B;r</span> and Al-M&#x101;m&#x16B;n
  and H&#x101;r&#x16B;n al-Rash&#x12B;d (Aaron the Just) made for a time
  the world's center of intellectual activity in general and in the domain
  of mathematics in particular.<a name="NtA_389"
  href="#Nt_389"><sup>[389]</sup></a> It was just after the <i>Sindhind</i>
  was brought to Bagdad that <span class="special"
  title="Mohammed">Mo&#x1E25;ammed</span> ibn M&#x16B;s&#x101;
  al-Khow&#x101;razm&#x12B;, whose name has already been mentioned,<a
  name="NtA_390" href="#Nt_390"><sup>[390]</sup></a> was called to that
  city. He was the most celebrated mathematician of his time, either in the
  East or West, writing treatises on arithmetic, the sundial, the
  astrolabe, chronology, geometry, and algebra, and giving through the
  Latin transliteration of his name, <i>algoritmi</i>, the name of algorism
  to the early arithmetics using the new Hindu numerals.<a name="NtA_391"
  href="#Nt_391"><sup>[391]</sup></a> Appreciating at once the value of the
  position system so recently brought from India, he wrote an arithmetic
  based upon these numerals, and this was translated into Latin in the time
  of Adelhard of Bath (c. 1180), although possibly by his contemporary
  countryman Robert Cestrensis.<a name="NtA_392"
  href="#Nt_392"><sup>[392]</sup></a> This translation was found in
  Cambridge and was published by Boncompagni in 1857.<a name="NtA_393"
  href="#Nt_393"><sup>[393]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Contemporary with Al-Khow&#x101;razm&#x12B;, and working also under
  Al-M&#x101;m&#x16B;n, was a Jewish astronomer, <span class="special"
  title="Abu 'l-Teiyib">Ab&#x16B; 'l-&#x1E6C;eiyib</span>, <!-- Page 98
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page98"></a>[98]</span>Sened ibn
  &#x201B;Al&#x12B;, who is said to have adopted the Mohammedan religion at
  the caliph's request. He also wrote a work on Hindu arithmetic,<a
  name="NtA_394" href="#Nt_394"><sup>[394]</sup></a> so that the subject
  must have been attracting considerable attention at that time. Indeed,
  the struggle to have the Hindu numerals replace the Arabic did not cease
  for a long time thereafter. &#x201B;Al&#x12B; ibn <span class="special"
  title="Ahmed">A&#x1E25;med</span> al-Nasaw&#x12B;, in his arithmetic of
  c. 1025, tells us that the symbolism of number was still unsettled in his
  day, although most people preferred the strictly Arabic forms.<a
  name="NtA_395" href="#Nt_395"><sup>[395]</sup></a></p>

  <p>We thus have the numerals in Arabia, in two forms: one the form now
  used there, and the other the one used by Al-Khow&#x101;razm&#x12B;. The
  question then remains, how did this second form find its way into Europe?
  and this question will be considered in the next chapter.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>

<p class="cenhead">THE DEFINITE INTRODUCTION OF THE NUMERALS
INTO EUROPE</p>

  <p>It being doubtful whether Boethius ever knew the Hindu numeral forms,
  certainly without the zero in any case, it becomes necessary now to
  consider the question of their definite introduction into Europe. From
  what has been said of the trade relations between the East and the West,
  and of the probability that it was the trader rather than the scholar who
  carried these numerals from their original habitat to various commercial
  centers, it is evident that we shall never know when they first made
  their inconspicuous entrance into Europe. Curious customs from the East
  and from the tropics,&mdash;concerning games, social peculiarities,
  oddities of dress, and the like,&mdash;are continually being related by
  sailors and traders in their resorts in New York, London, Hamburg, and
  Rotterdam to-day, customs that no scholar has yet described in print and
  that may not become known for many years, if ever. And if this be so now,
  how much more would it have been true a thousand years before the
  invention of printing, when learning was at its lowest ebb. It was at
  this period of low esteem of culture that the Hindu numerals undoubtedly
  made their first appearance in Europe.</p>

  <p>There were many opportunities for such knowledge to reach Spain and
  Italy. In the first place the Moors went into Spain as helpers of a
  claimant of the throne, and <!-- Page 100 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page100"></a>[100]</span>remained as conquerors. The power of the
  Goths, who had held Spain for three centuries, was shattered at the
  battle of Jerez de la Frontera in 711, and almost immediately the Moors
  became masters of Spain and so remained for five hundred years, and
  masters of Granada for a much longer period. Until 850 the Christians
  were absolutely free as to religion and as to holding political office,
  so that priests and monks were not infrequently skilled both in Latin and
  Arabic, acting as official translators, and naturally reporting directly
  or indirectly to Rome. There was indeed at this time a complaint that
  Christian youths cultivated too assiduously a love for the literature of
  the Saracen, and married too frequently the daughters of the infidel.<a
  name="NtA_396" href="#Nt_396"><sup>[396]</sup></a> It is true that this
  happy state of affairs was not permanent, but while it lasted the
  learning and the customs of the East must have become more or less the
  property of Christian Spain. At this time the &#x121;ob&#x101;r numerals
  were probably in that country, and these may well have made their way
  into Europe from the schools of Cordova, Granada, and Toledo.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, there was abundant opportunity for the numerals of the
  East to reach Europe through the journeys of travelers and ambassadors.
  It was from the records of Suleim&#x101;n the Merchant, a well-known Arab
  trader of the ninth century, that part of the story of Sindb&#x101;d the
  Sailor was taken.<a name="NtA_397" href="#Nt_397"><sup>[397]</sup></a>
  Such a merchant would have been particularly likely to know the numerals
  of the people whom he met, and he is a type of man that may well have
  taken such symbols to European markets. A little later, <!-- Page 101
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page101"></a>[101]</span><span
  class="special" title="Abu 'l-Hasan">Ab&#x16B; 'l-&#x1E24;asan</span>
  &#x201B;Al&#x12B; al-Mas&#x201B;&#x16B;d&#x12B; (d. 956) of Bagdad
  traveled to the China Sea on the east, at least as far south as Zanzibar,
  and to the Atlantic on the west,<a name="NtA_398"
  href="#Nt_398"><sup>[398]</sup></a> and he speaks of the nine figures
  with which the Hindus reckoned.<a name="NtA_399"
  href="#Nt_399"><sup>[399]</sup></a></p>

  <p>There was also a Bagdad merchant, one Ab&#x16B; 'l-Q&#x101;sim
  &#x201B;Obeidall&#x101;h ibn <span class="special"
  title="Ahmed">A&#x1E25;med</span>, better known by his Persian name <span
  class="special" title="Ibn Khordadbeh">Ibn
  Khord&#x101;&#x1E0D;beh</span>,<a name="NtA_400"
  href="#Nt_400"><sup>[400]</sup></a> who wrote about 850 <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> a work entitled <i>Book of Roads and
  Provinces</i><a name="NtA_401" href="#Nt_401"><sup>[401]</sup></a> in
  which the following graphic account appears:<a name="NtA_402"
  href="#Nt_402"><sup>[402]</sup></a> "The Jewish merchants speak Persian,
  Roman (Greek and Latin), Arabic, French, Spanish, and Slavic. They travel
  from the West to the East, and from the East to the West, sometimes by
  land, sometimes by sea. They take ship from France on the Western Sea,
  and they voyage to Farama (near the ruins of the ancient Pelusium); there
  they transfer their goods to caravans and go by land to Colzom (on the
  Red Sea). They there reëmbark on the Oriental (Red) Sea and go to Hejaz
  and to Jiddah, and thence to the Sind, India, and China. Returning, they
  bring back the products of the oriental lands.... These journeys are also
  made by land. The merchants, leaving France and Spain, cross to Tangier
  and thence pass through the African provinces and Egypt. They then go to
  Ramleh, visit Damascus, Kufa, Bagdad, and Basra, penetrate into Ahwaz,
  Fars, Kerman, Sind, and thus reach India and China." Such travelers,
  about 900 <span class="scac">A.D.</span>, must necessarily have spread
  abroad a knowledge of all number <!-- Page 102 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page102"></a>[102]</span>systems used in
  recording prices or in the computations of the market. There is an
  interesting witness to this movement, a cruciform brooch now in the
  British Museum. It is English, certainly as early as the eleventh
  century, but it is inlaid with a piece of paste on which is the
  Mohammedan inscription, in Kufic characters, "There is no God but God."
  How did such an inscription find its way, perhaps in the time of Alcuin
  of York, to England? And if these Kufic characters reached there, then
  why not the numeral forms as well?</p>

  <p>Even in literature of the better class there appears now and then some
  stray proof of the important fact that the great trade routes to the far
  East were never closed for long, and that the customs and marks of trade
  endured from generation to generation. The <i>Gulist&#x101;n</i> of the
  Persian poet Sa&#x201B;d&#x12B;<a name="NtA_403"
  href="#Nt_403"><sup>[403]</sup></a> contains such a passage:</p>

  <p>"I met a merchant who owned one hundred and forty camels, and fifty
  slaves and porters.... He answered to me: 'I want to carry sulphur of
  Persia to China, which in that country, as I hear, bears a high price;
  and thence to take Chinese ware to Roum; and from Roum to load up with
  brocades for Hind; and so to trade Indian steel (<i>pûlab</i>) to Halib.
  From Halib I will convey its glass to Yeman, and carry the painted cloths
  of Yeman back to Persia.'"<a name="NtA_404"
  href="#Nt_404"><sup>[404]</sup></a> On the other hand, these men were not
  of the learned class, nor would they preserve in treatises any knowledge
  that they might have, although this knowledge would occasionally reach
  the ears of the learned as bits of curious information.</p>

<p><!-- Page 103 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page103"></a>[103]</span></p>

  <p>There were also ambassadors passing back and forth from time to time,
  between the East and the West, and in particular during the period when
  these numerals probably began to enter Europe. Thus Charlemagne (c. 800)
  sent emissaries to Bagdad just at the time of the opening of the
  mathematical activity there.<a name="NtA_405"
  href="#Nt_405"><sup>[405]</sup></a> And with such ambassadors must have
  gone the adventurous scholar, inspired, as Alcuin says of Archbishop
  Albert of York (766-780),<a name="NtA_406"
  href="#Nt_406"><sup>[406]</sup></a> to seek the learning of other lands.
  Furthermore, the Nestorian communities, established in Eastern Asia and
  in India at this time, were favored both by the Persians and by their
  Mohammedan conquerors. The Nestorian Patriarch of Syria, Timotheus
  (778-820), sent missionaries both to India and to China, and a bishop was
  appointed for the latter field. Ibn Wahab, who traveled to China in the
  ninth century, found images of Christ and the apostles in the Emperor's
  court.<a name="NtA_407" href="#Nt_407"><sup>[407]</sup></a> Such a
  learned body of men, knowing intimately the countries in which they
  labored, could hardly have failed to make strange customs known as they
  returned to their home stations. Then, too, in Alfred's time (849-901)
  emissaries went <!-- Page 104 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page104"></a>[104]</span>from England as far as India,<a
  name="NtA_408" href="#Nt_408"><sup>[408]</sup></a> and generally in the
  Middle Ages groceries came to Europe from Asia as now they come from the
  colonies and from America. Syria, Asia Minor, and Cyprus furnished sugar
  and wool, and India yielded her perfumes and spices, while rich
  tapestries for the courts and the wealthy burghers came from Persia and
  from China.<a name="NtA_409" href="#Nt_409"><sup>[409]</sup></a> Even in
  the time of Justinian (c. 550) there seems to have been a silk trade with
  China, which country in turn carried on commerce with Ceylon,<a
  name="NtA_410" href="#Nt_410"><sup>[410]</sup></a> and reached out to
  Turkestan where other merchants transmitted the Eastern products
  westward. In the seventh century there was a well-defined commerce
  between Persia and India, as well as between Persia and Constantinople.<a
  name="NtA_411" href="#Nt_411"><sup>[411]</sup></a> The Byzantine
  <i>commerciarii</i> were stationed at the outposts not merely as customs
  officers but as government purchasing agents.<a name="NtA_412"
  href="#Nt_412"><sup>[412]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Occasionally there went along these routes of trade men of real
  learning, and such would surely have carried the knowledge of many
  customs back and forth. Thus at a period when the numerals are known to
  have been partly understood in Italy, at the opening of the eleventh
  century, one Constantine, an African, traveled from Italy through a great
  part of Africa and Asia, even on to India, for the purpose of learning
  the sciences of the Orient. He spent thirty-nine years in travel, having
  been hospitably received in Babylon, and upon his return he was welcomed
  with great honor at Salerno.<a name="NtA_413"
  href="#Nt_413"><sup>[413]</sup></a></p>

  <p>A very interesting illustration of this intercourse also appears in
  the tenth century, when the son of Otto I <!-- Page 105 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page105"></a>[105]</span>(936-973) married a
  princess from Constantinople. This monarch was in touch with the Moors of
  Spain and invited to his court numerous scholars from abroad,<a
  name="NtA_414" href="#Nt_414"><sup>[414]</sup></a> and his intercourse
  with the East as well as the West must have brought together much of the
  learning of each.</p>

  <p>Another powerful means for the circulation of mysticism and
  philosophy, and more or less of culture, took its start just before the
  conversion of Constantine (c. 312), in the form of Christian pilgrim
  travel. This was a feature peculiar to the zealots of early Christianity,
  found in only a slight degree among their Jewish predecessors in the
  annual pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and almost wholly wanting in other
  pre-Christian peoples. Chief among these early pilgrims were the two
  Placentians, John and Antonine the Elder (c. 303), who, in their
  wanderings to Jerusalem, seem to have started a movement which culminated
  centuries later in the crusades.<a name="NtA_415"
  href="#Nt_415"><sup>[415]</sup></a> In 333 a Bordeaux pilgrim compiled
  the first Christian guide-book, the <i>Itinerary from Bordeaux to
  Jerusalem</i>,<a name="NtA_416" href="#Nt_416"><sup>[416]</sup></a> and
  from this time on the holy pilgrimage never entirely ceased.</p>

  <p>Still another certain route for the entrance of the numerals into
  Christian Europe was through the pillaging and trading carried on by the
  Arabs on the northern shores of the Mediterranean. As early as 652 <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span>, in the thirtieth year of the Hejira, the
  Mohammedans descended upon the shores of Sicily and took much spoil.
  Hardly had the wretched Constans given place to the <!-- Page 106
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page106"></a>[106]</span>young
  Constantine IV when they again attacked the island and plundered ancient
  Syracuse. Again in 827, under Asad, they ravaged the coasts. Although at
  this time they failed to conquer Syracuse, they soon held a good part of
  the island, and a little later they successfully besieged the city.
  Before Syracuse fell, however, they had plundered the shores of Italy,
  even to the walls of Rome itself; and had not Leo IV, in 849, repaired
  the neglected fortifications, the effects of the Moslem raid of that year
  might have been very far-reaching. <span class="special" title="Ibn Khordadbeh"
  >Ibn Khord&#x101;&#x1E0D;beh</span>, who left Bagdad in the latter part
  of the ninth century, gives a picture of the great commercial activity at
  that time in the Saracen city of Palermo. In this same century they had
  established themselves in Piedmont, and in 906 they pillaged Turin.<a
  name="NtA_417" href="#Nt_417"><sup>[417]</sup></a> On the Sorrento
  peninsula the traveler who climbs the hill to the beautiful Ravello sees
  still several traces of the Arab architecture, reminding him of the fact
  that about 900 <span class="scac">A.D.</span> Amalfi was a commercial
  center of the Moors.<a name="NtA_418" href="#Nt_418"><sup>[418]</sup></a>
  Not only at this time, but even a century earlier, the artists of
  northern India sold their wares at such centers, and in the courts both
  of H&#x101;r&#x16B;n al-Rash&#x12B;d and of Charlemagne.<a name="NtA_419"
  href="#Nt_419"><sup>[419]</sup></a> Thus the Arabs dominated the
  Mediterranean Sea long before Venice</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i12">"held the gorgeous East in fee</p>
      <p>And was the safeguard of the West,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>and long before Genoa had become her powerful rival.<a name="NtA_420"
  href="#Nt_420"><sup>[420]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 107 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page107"></a>[107]</span></p>

  <p>Only a little later than this the brothers Nicolo and Maffeo Polo
  entered upon their famous wanderings.<a name="NtA_421"
  href="#Nt_421"><sup>[421]</sup></a> Leaving Constantinople in 1260, they
  went by the Sea of Azov to Bokhara, and thence to the court of Kublai
  Khan, penetrating China, and returning by way of Acre in 1269 with a
  commission which required them to go back to China two years later. This
  time they took with them Nicolo's son Marco, the historian of the
  journey, and went across the plateau of Pamir; they spent about twenty
  years in China, and came back by sea from China to Persia.</p>

  <p>The ventures of the Poli were not long unique, however: the thirteenth
  century had not closed before Roman missionaries and the merchant Petrus
  de Lucolongo had penetrated China. Before 1350 the company of
  missionaries was large, converts were numerous, churches and Franciscan
  convents had been organized in the East, travelers were appealing for the
  truth of their accounts to the "many" persons in Venice who had been in
  China, Tsuan-chau-fu had a European merchant community, and Italian trade
  and travel to China was a thing that occupied two chapters of a
  commercial handbook.<a name="NtA_422"
  href="#Nt_422"><sup>[422]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 108 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page108"></a>[108]</span></p>

  <p>It is therefore reasonable to conclude that in the Middle Ages, as in
  the time of Boethius, it was a simple matter for any inquiring scholar to
  become acquainted with such numerals of the Orient as merchants may have
  used for warehouse or price marks. And the fact that Gerbert seems to
  have known only the forms of the simplest of these, not comprehending
  their full significance, seems to prove that he picked them up in just
  this way.</p>

  <p>Even if Gerbert did not bring his knowledge of the Oriental numerals
  from Spain, he may easily have obtained them from the marks on merchant's
  goods, had he been so inclined. Such knowledge was probably obtainable in
  various parts of Italy, though as parts of mere mercantile knowledge the
  forms might soon have been lost, it needing the pen of the scholar to
  preserve them. Trade at this time was not stagnant. During the eleventh
  and twelfth centuries the Slavs, for example, had very great commercial
  interests, their trade reaching to Kiev and Novgorod, and thence to the
  East. Constantinople was a great clearing-house of commerce with the
  Orient,<a name="NtA_423" href="#Nt_423"><sup>[423]</sup></a> and the
  Byzantine merchants must have been entirely familiar with the various
  numerals of the Eastern peoples. In the eleventh century the Italian town
  of Amalfi established a factory<a name="NtA_424"
  href="#Nt_424"><sup>[424]</sup></a> in Constantinople, and had trade
  relations with Antioch and Egypt. Venice, as early as the ninth century,
  had a valuable trade with Syria and Cairo.<a name="NtA_425"
  href="#Nt_425"><sup>[425]</sup></a> Fifty years after Gerbert died, in
  the time of Cnut, the Dane and the Norwegian pushed their commerce far
  beyond the northern seas, both by caravans through Russia to the Orient,
  and by their venturesome barks which <!-- Page 109 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page109"></a>[109]</span>sailed through the
  Strait of Gibraltar into the Mediterranean.<a name="NtA_426"
  href="#Nt_426"><sup>[426]</sup></a> Only a little later, probably before
  1200 <span class="scac">A.D.</span>, a clerk in the service of Thomas à
  Becket, present at the latter's death, wrote a life of the martyr, to
  which (fortunately for our purposes) he prefixed a brief eulogy of the
  city of London.<a name="NtA_427" href="#Nt_427"><sup>[427]</sup></a> This
  clerk, William Fitz Stephen by name, thus speaks of the British
  capital:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Aurum mittit Arabs: species et thura Sabæus:</p>
      <p>Arma Sythes: oleum palmarum divite sylva</p>
      <p>Pingue solum Babylon: Nilus lapides pretiosos:</p>
      <p>Norwegi, Russi, varium grisum, sabdinas:</p>
      <p>Seres, purpureas vestes: Galli, sua vina.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Although, as a matter of fact, the Arabs had no gold to send, and the
  Scythians no arms, and Egypt no precious stones save only the turquoise,
  the Chinese (<i>Seres</i>) may have sent their purple vestments, and the
  north her sables and other furs, and France her wines. At any rate the
  verses show very clearly an extensive foreign trade.</p>

  <p>Then there were the Crusades, which in these times brought the East in
  touch with the West. The spirit of the Orient showed itself in the songs
  of the troubadours, and the <i>baudekin</i>,<a name="NtA_428"
  href="#Nt_428"><sup>[428]</sup></a> the canopy of Bagdad,<a
  name="NtA_429" href="#Nt_429"><sup>[429]</sup></a> became common in the
  churches of Italy. In Sicily and in Venice the textile industries of the
  East found place, and made their way even to the Scandinavian
  peninsula.<a name="NtA_430" href="#Nt_430"><sup>[430]</sup></a></p>

  <p>We therefore have this state of affairs: There was abundant
  intercourse between the East and West for <!-- Page 110 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page110"></a>[110]</span>some centuries before
  the Hindu numerals appear in any manuscripts in Christian Europe. The
  numerals must of necessity have been known to many traders in a country
  like Italy at least as early as the ninth century, and probably even
  earlier, but there was no reason for preserving them in treatises.
  Therefore when a man like Gerbert made them known to the scholarly
  circles, he was merely describing what had been familiar in a small way
  to many people in a different walk of life.</p>

  <p>Since Gerbert<a name="NtA_431" href="#Nt_431"><sup>[431]</sup></a> was
  for a long time thought to have been the one to introduce the numerals
  into Italy,<a name="NtA_432" href="#Nt_432"><sup>[432]</sup></a> a brief
  sketch of this unique character is proper. Born of humble parents,<a
  name="NtA_433" href="#Nt_433"><sup>[433]</sup></a> this remarkable man
  became the counselor and companion of kings, and finally wore the papal
  tiara as Sylvester II, from 999 until his death in 1003.<a name="NtA_434"
  href="#Nt_434"><sup>[434]</sup></a> He was early brought under the
  influence of the monks at Aurillac, and particularly of Raimund, who had
  been a pupil of Odo of Cluny, and there in due time he himself took holy
  orders. He visited Spain in about 967 in company with Count Borel,<a
  name="NtA_435" href="#Nt_435"><sup>[435]</sup></a> remaining there three
  years, <!-- Page 111 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page111"></a>[111]</span>and studying under Bishop Hatto of Vich,<a
  name="NtA_436" href="#Nt_436"><sup>[436]</sup></a> a city in the province
  of Barcelona,<a name="NtA_437" href="#Nt_437"><sup>[437]</sup></a> then
  entirely under Christian rule. Indeed, all of Gerbert's testimony is as
  to the influence of the Christian civilization upon his education. Thus
  he speaks often of his study of Boethius,<a name="NtA_438"
  href="#Nt_438"><sup>[438]</sup></a> so that if the latter knew the
  numerals Gerbert would have learned them from him.<a name="NtA_439"
  href="#Nt_439"><sup>[439]</sup></a> If Gerbert had studied in any Moorish
  schools he would, under the decree of the emir Hish&#x101;m (787-822),
  have been obliged to know Arabic, which would have taken most of his
  three years in Spain, and of which study we have not the slightest hint
  in any of his letters.<a name="NtA_440"
  href="#Nt_440"><sup>[440]</sup></a> On the other hand, Barcelona was the
  only Christian province in immediate touch with the Moorish civilization
  at that time.<a name="NtA_441" href="#Nt_441"><sup>[441]</sup></a>
  Furthermore we know that earlier in the same century King Alonzo of
  Asturias (d. 910) confided the education of his son Ordoño to the Arab
  scholars of the court of the <!-- Page 112 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page112"></a>[112]</span>w&#x101;l&#x12B; of Saragossa,<a
  name="NtA_442" href="#Nt_442"><sup>[442]</sup></a> so that there was more
  or less of friendly relation between Christian and Moor.</p>

  <p>After his three years in Spain, Gerbert went to Italy, about 970,
  where he met Pope John XIII, being by him presented to the emperor Otto
  I. Two years later (972), at the emperor's request, he went to Rheims,
  where he studied philosophy, assisting to make of that place an
  educational center; and in 983 he became abbot at Bobbio. The next year
  he returned to Rheims, and became archbishop of that diocese in 991. For
  political reasons he returned to Italy in 996, became archbishop of
  Ravenna in 998, and the following year was elected to the papal chair.
  Far ahead of his age in wisdom, he suffered as many such scholars have
  even in times not so remote by being accused of heresy and witchcraft. As
  late as 1522, in a biography published at Venice, it is related that by
  black art he attained the papacy, after having given his soul to the
  devil.<a name="NtA_443" href="#Nt_443"><sup>[443]</sup></a> Gerbert was,
  however, interested in astrology,<a name="NtA_444"
  href="#Nt_444"><sup>[444]</sup></a> although this was merely the
  astronomy of that time and was such a science as any learned man would
  wish to know, even as to-day we wish to be reasonably familiar with
  physics and chemistry.</p>

  <p>That Gerbert and his pupils knew the &#x121;ob&#x101;r numerals is a
  fact no longer open to controversy.<a name="NtA_445"
  href="#Nt_445"><sup>[445]</sup></a> Bernelinus and Richer<a
  name="NtA_446" href="#Nt_446"><sup>[446]</sup></a> call them by the
  well-known name of <!-- Page 113 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page113"></a>[113]</span>"caracteres," a word used by Radulph of
  Laon in the same sense a century later.<a name="NtA_447"
  href="#Nt_447"><sup>[447]</sup></a> It is probable that Gerbert was the
  first to describe these &#x121;ob&#x101;r numerals in any scientific way
  in Christian Europe, but without the zero. If he knew the latter he
  certainly did not understand its use.<a name="NtA_448"
  href="#Nt_448"><sup>[448]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The question still to be settled is as to where he found these
  numerals. That he did not bring them from Spain is the opinion of a
  number of careful investigators.<a name="NtA_449"
  href="#Nt_449"><sup>[449]</sup></a> This is thought to be the more
  probable because most of the men who made Spain famous for learning lived
  after Gerbert was there. Such were Ibn S&#x12B;n&#x101; (Avicenna) who
  lived at the beginning, and Gerber of Seville who flourished in the
  middle, of the eleventh century, and Ab&#x16B; Roshd (Averroës) who lived
  at the end of the twelfth.<a name="NtA_450"
  href="#Nt_450"><sup>[450]</sup></a> Others hold that his proximity to
  <!-- Page 114 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page114"></a>[114]</span>the Arabs for three years makes it
  probable that he assimilated some of their learning, in spite of the fact
  that the lines between Christian and Moor at that time were sharply
  drawn.<a name="NtA_451" href="#Nt_451"><sup>[451]</sup></a> Writers fail,
  however, to recognize that a commercial numeral system would have been
  more likely to be made known by merchants than by scholars. The itinerant
  peddler knew no forbidden pale in Spain, any more than he has known one
  in other lands. If the &#x121;ob&#x101;r numerals were used for marking
  wares or keeping simple accounts, it was he who would have known them,
  and who would have been the one rather than any Arab scholar to bring
  them to the inquiring mind of the young French monk. The facts that
  Gerbert knew them only imperfectly, that he used them solely for
  calculations, and that the forms are evidently like the Spanish
  &#x121;ob&#x101;r, make it all the more probable that it was through the
  small tradesman of the Moors that this versatile scholar derived his
  knowledge. Moreover the part of the geometry bearing his name, and that
  seems unquestionably his, shows the Arab influence, proving that he at
  least came into contact with the transplanted Oriental learning, even
  though imperfectly.<a name="NtA_452" href="#Nt_452"><sup>[452]</sup></a>
  There was also the persistent Jewish merchant trading with both peoples
  then as now, always alive to the acquiring of useful knowledge, and it
  would be very natural for a man like Gerbert to welcome learning from
  such a source.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the two leading sources of information as to the
  life of Gerbert reveal practically nothing to show that he came within
  the Moorish sphere of influence during his sojourn in Spain. These
  sources <!-- Page 115 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page115"></a>[115]</span>are his letters and the history written by
  Richer. Gerbert was a master of the epistolary art, and his exalted
  position led to the preservation of his letters to a degree that would
  not have been vouchsafed even by their classic excellence.<a
  name="NtA_453" href="#Nt_453"><sup>[453]</sup></a> Richer was a monk at
  St. Remi de Rheims, and was doubtless a pupil of Gerbert. The latter,
  when archbishop of Rheims, asked Richer to write a history of his times,
  and this was done. The work lay in manuscript, entirely forgotten until
  Pertz discovered it at Bamberg in 1833.<a name="NtA_454"
  href="#Nt_454"><sup>[454]</sup></a> The work is dedicated to Gerbert as
  archbishop of Rheims,<a name="NtA_455"
  href="#Nt_455"><sup>[455]</sup></a> and would assuredly have testified to
  such efforts as he may have made to secure the learning of the Moors.</p>

  <p>Now it is a fact that neither the letters nor this history makes any
  statement as to Gerbert's contact with the Saracens. The letters do not
  speak of the Moors, of the Arab numerals, nor of Cordova. Spain is not
  referred to by that name, and only one Spanish scholar is mentioned. In
  one of his letters he speaks of Joseph Ispanus,<a name="NtA_456"
  href="#Nt_456"><sup>[456]</sup></a> or Joseph Sapiens, but who this
  Joseph the Wise of Spain may have been we do not know. Possibly <!-- Page
  116 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page116"></a>[116]</span>it was he
  who contributed the morsel of knowledge so imperfectly assimilated by the
  young French monk.<a name="NtA_457" href="#Nt_457"><sup>[457]</sup></a>
  Within a few years after Gerbert's visit two young Spanish monks of
  lesser fame, and doubtless with not that keen interest in mathematical
  matters which Gerbert had, regarded the apparently slight knowledge which
  they had of the Hindu numeral forms as worthy of somewhat permanent
  record<a name="NtA_458" href="#Nt_458"><sup>[458]</sup></a> in
  manuscripts which they were transcribing. The fact that such knowledge
  had penetrated to their modest cloisters in northern Spain&mdash;the one
  Albelda or Albaida&mdash;indicates that it was rather widely
  diffused.</p>

  <p>Gerbert's treatise <i>Libellus de numerorum divisione</i><a
  name="NtA_459" href="#Nt_459"><sup>[459]</sup></a> is characterized by
  Chasles as "one of the most obscure documents in the history of
  science."<a name="NtA_460" href="#Nt_460"><sup>[460]</sup></a> The most
  complete information in regard to this and the other mathematical works
  of Gerbert is given by Bubnov,<a name="NtA_461"
  href="#Nt_461"><sup>[461]</sup></a> who considers this work to be
  genuine.<a name="NtA_462" href="#Nt_462"><sup>[462]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 117 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page117"></a>[117]</span></p>

  <p>So little did Gerbert appreciate these numerals that in his works
  known as the <i>Regula de abaco computi</i> and the <i>Libellus</i> he
  makes no use of them at all, employing only the Roman forms.<a
  name="NtA_463" href="#Nt_463"><sup>[463]</sup></a> Nevertheless
  Bernelinus<a name="NtA_464" href="#Nt_464"><sup>[464]</sup></a> refers to
  the nine &#x121;ob&#x101;r characters.<a name="NtA_465"
  href="#Nt_465"><sup>[465]</sup></a> These Gerbert had marked on a
  thousand <i>jetons</i> or counters,<a name="NtA_466"
  href="#Nt_466"><sup>[466]</sup></a> using the latter on an abacus which
  he had a sign-maker prepare for him.<a name="NtA_467"
  href="#Nt_467"><sup>[467]</sup></a> Instead of putting eight counters in
  say the tens' column, Gerbert would put a single counter marked 8, and so
  for the other places, leaving the column empty where we would place a
  zero, but where he, lacking the zero, had no counter to place. These
  counters he possibly called <i>caracteres</i>, a name which adhered also
  to the figures themselves. It is an interesting speculation to consider
  whether these <i>apices</i>, as they are called in the Boethius
  interpolations, were in any way suggested by those Roman jetons generally
  known in numismatics as <i>tesserae</i>, and bearing the figures I-XVI,
  the sixteen referring to the number of <i>assi</i> in a
  <i>sestertius</i>.<a name="NtA_468" href="#Nt_468"><sup>[468]</sup></a>
  The <!-- Page 118 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page118"></a>[118]</span>name <i>apices</i> adhered to the
  Hindu-Arabic numerals until the sixteenth century.<a name="NtA_469"
  href="#Nt_469"><sup>[469]</sup></a></p>

  <p>To the figures on the <i>apices</i> were given the names Igin, andras,
  ormis, arbas, quimas, calctis or caltis, zenis, temenias, celentis,
  sipos,<a name="NtA_470" href="#Nt_470"><sup>[470]</sup></a> the origin
  and meaning of which still remain a mystery. The Semitic origin of
  several of the words seems probable. <i>Wahud</i>, <i>thaneine</i>, <!--
  Page 119 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page119"></a>[119]</span><i>thalata</i>, <i>arba</i>, <i>kumsa</i>,
  <i>setta</i>, <i>sebba</i>, <i>timinia</i>, <i>taseud</i> are given by
  the Rev. R. Patrick<a name="NtA_471" href="#Nt_471"><sup>[471]</sup></a>
  as the names, in an Arabic dialect used in Morocco, for the numerals from
  one to nine. Of these the words for four, five, and eight are strikingly
  like those given above.</p>

  <p>The name <i>apices</i> was not, however, a common one in later times.
  <i>Notae</i> was more often used, and it finally gave the name to
  notation.<a name="NtA_472" href="#Nt_472"><sup>[472]</sup></a> Still more
  common were the names <i>figures</i>, <i>ciphers</i>, <i>signs</i>,
  <i>elements</i>, and <i>characters</i>.<a name="NtA_473"
  href="#Nt_473"><sup>[473]</sup></a></p>

  <p>So little effect did the teachings of Gerbert have in making known the
  new numerals, that O'Creat, who lived a century later, a friend and pupil
  of Adelhard <!-- Page 120 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page120"></a>[120]</span>of Bath, used the zero with the Roman
  characters, in contrast to Gerbert's use of the &#x121;ob&#x101;r forms
  without the zero.<a name="NtA_474" href="#Nt_474"><sup>[474]</sup></a>
  O'Creat uses three forms for zero, o, &#x14D;, and <span title="t" class="grk"
  >&tau;</span>, as in Maximus Planudes. With this use of the zero goes,
  naturally, a place value, for he writes III&nbsp;III for 33, ICCOO and
  I.&nbsp;II.&nbsp;<span class="grk">&tau;</span>.&nbsp;<span class="grk">&tau;</span> for
  1200, I.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;VIII.&nbsp;IX for 1089, and I.&nbsp;IIII.&nbsp;IIII.&nbsp;<span
  class="grk">&tau;</span><span class="grk">&tau;</span><span
  class="grk">&tau;</span><span class="grk">&tau;</span> for the square of
  1200.</p>

  <p>The period from the time of Gerbert until after the appearance of
  Leonardo's monumental work may be called the period of the abacists. Even
  for many years after the appearance early in the twelfth century of the
  books explaining the Hindu art of reckoning, there was strife between the
  abacists, the advocates of the abacus, and the algorists, those who
  favored the new numerals. The words <i>cifra</i> and <i>algorismus
  cifra</i> were used with a somewhat derisive significance, indicative of
  absolute uselessness, as indeed the zero is useless on an abacus in which
  the value of any unit is given by the column which it occupies.<a
  name="NtA_475" href="#Nt_475"><sup>[475]</sup></a> So Gautier de Coincy
  (1177-1236) in a work on the miracles of Mary says:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>A horned beast, a sheep,</p>
      <p>An algorismus-cipher,</p>
      <p>Is a priest, who on such a feast day</p>
      <p>Does not celebrate the holy Mother.<a name="NtA_476" href="#Nt_476"><sup>[476]</sup></a></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>So the abacus held the field for a long time, even against the new
  algorism employing the new numerals. <!-- Page 121 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page121"></a>[121]</span>Geoffrey Chaucer<a
  name="NtA_477" href="#Nt_477"><sup>[477]</sup></a> describes in <i>The
  Miller's Tale</i> the clerk with</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"His Almageste and bokes grete and smale,</p>
      <p>His astrelabie, longinge for his art,</p>
      <p>His augrim-stones layen faire apart</p>
      <p>On shelves couched at his beddes heed."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>So, too, in Chaucer's explanation of the astrolabe,<a name="NtA_478"
  href="#Nt_478"><sup>[478]</sup></a> written for his son Lewis, the number
  of degrees is expressed on the instrument in Hindu-Arabic numerals: "Over
  the whiche degrees ther ben noumbres of augrim, that devyden thilke same
  degrees fro fyve to fyve," and "... the nombres ... ben writen in
  augrim," meaning in the way of the algorism. Thomas Usk about 1387
  writes:<a name="NtA_479" href="#Nt_479"><sup>[479]</sup></a> "a sypher in
  augrim have no might in signification of it-selve, yet he yeveth power in
  signification to other." So slow and so painful is the assimilation of
  new ideas.</p>

  <p>Bernelinus<a name="NtA_480" href="#Nt_480"><sup>[480]</sup></a> states
  that the abacus is a well-polished board (or table), which is covered
  with blue sand and used by geometers in drawing geometrical figures. We
  have previously mentioned the fact that the Hindus also performed
  mathematical computations in the sand, although there is no evidence to
  show that they had any column abacus.<a name="NtA_481"
  href="#Nt_481"><sup>[481]</sup></a> For the purposes of computation,
  Bernelinus continues, the board is divided into thirty vertical columns,
  three of which are reserved for fractions. Beginning with the units
  columns, each set of <!-- Page 122 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page122"></a>[122]</span>three columns (<i>lineae</i> is the word
  which Bernelinus uses) is grouped together by a semicircular arc placed
  above them, while a smaller arc is placed over the units column and
  another joins the tens and hundreds columns. Thus arose the designation
  <i>arcus pictagore</i><a name="NtA_482"
  href="#Nt_482"><sup>[482]</sup></a> or sometimes simply <i>arcus</i>.<a
  name="NtA_483" href="#Nt_483"><sup>[483]</sup></a> The operations of
  addition, subtraction, and multiplication upon this form of the abacus
  required little explanation, although they were rather extensively
  treated, especially the multiplication of different orders of numbers.
  But the operation of division was effected with some difficulty. For the
  explanation of the method of division by the use of the complementary
  difference,<a name="NtA_484" href="#Nt_484"><sup>[484]</sup></a> long the
  stumbling-block in the way of the medieval arithmetician, the reader is
  referred to works on the history of mathematics<a name="NtA_485"
  href="#Nt_485"><sup>[485]</sup></a> and to works relating particularly to
  the abacus.<a name="NtA_486" href="#Nt_486"><sup>[486]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Among the writers on the subject may be mentioned Abbo<a
  name="NtA_487" href="#Nt_487"><sup>[487]</sup></a> of Fleury (c. 970),
  Heriger<a name="NtA_488" href="#Nt_488"><sup>[488]</sup></a> of Lobbes or
  Laubach <!-- Page 123 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page123"></a>[123]</span>(c. 950-1007), and Hermannus Contractus<a
  name="NtA_489" href="#Nt_489"><sup>[489]</sup></a> (1013-1054), all of
  whom employed only the Roman numerals. Similarly Adelhard of Bath (c.
  1130), in his work <i>Regulae Abaci</i>,<a name="NtA_490"
  href="#Nt_490"><sup>[490]</sup></a> gives no reference to the new
  numerals, although it is certain that he knew them. Other writers on the
  abacus who used some form of Hindu numerals were Gerland<a name="NtA_491"
  href="#Nt_491"><sup>[491]</sup></a> (first half of twelfth century) and
  Turchill<a name="NtA_492" href="#Nt_492"><sup>[492]</sup></a> (c. 1200).
  For the forms used at this period the reader is referred to the plate on
  page <a href="#page88">88</a>.</p>

  <p>After Gerbert's death, little by little the scholars of Europe came to
  know the new figures, chiefly through the introduction of Arab learning.
  The Dark Ages had passed, although arithmetic did not find another
  advocate as prominent as Gerbert for two centuries. Speaking of this
  great revival, Raoul Glaber<a name="NtA_493"
  href="#Nt_493"><sup>[493]</sup></a> (985-c. 1046), a monk of the great
  Benedictine abbey of Cluny, of the eleventh century, says: "It was as
  though the world had arisen and tossed aside the worn-out garments of
  ancient time, and wished to apparel itself in a white robe of churches."
  And with this activity in religion came a corresponding interest in other
  lines. Algorisms began to appear, and knowledge from the outside world
  found <!-- Page 124 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page124"></a>[124]</span>interested listeners. Another Raoul, or
  Radulph, to whom we have referred as Radulph of Laon,<a name="NtA_494"
  href="#Nt_494"><sup>[494]</sup></a> a teacher in the cloister school of
  his city, and the brother of Anselm of Laon<a name="NtA_495"
  href="#Nt_495"><sup>[495]</sup></a> the celebrated theologian, wrote a
  treatise on music, extant but unpublished, and an arithmetic which Nagl
  first published in 1890.<a name="NtA_496"
  href="#Nt_496"><sup>[496]</sup></a> The latter work, preserved to us in a
  parchment manuscript of seventy-seven leaves, contains a curious mixture
  of Roman and &#x121;ob&#x101;r numerals, the former for expressing large
  results, the latter for practical calculation. These &#x121;ob&#x101;r
  "caracteres" include the sipos (zero), <a href="images/130a.png"><img
  src="images/130a.png" class="middle" style="height:2ex" alt="Symbol"
  /></a>, of which, however, Radulph did not know the full significance;
  showing that at the opening of the twelfth century the system was still
  uncertain in its status in the church schools of central France.</p>

  <p>At the same time the words <i>algorismus</i> and <i>cifra</i> were
  coming into general use even in non-mathematical literature. Jordan <a
  name="NtA_497" href="#Nt_497"><sup>[497]</sup></a> cites numerous
  instances of such use from the works of Alanus ab Insulis<a
  name="NtA_498" href="#Nt_498"><sup>[498]</sup></a> (Alain de Lille),
  Gautier de Coincy (1177-1236), and others.</p>

  <p>Another contributor to arithmetic during this interesting period was a
  prominent Spanish Jew called variously John of Luna, John of Seville,
  Johannes Hispalensis, Johannes Toletanus, and Johannes Hispanensis de
  Luna.<a name="NtA_499" href="#Nt_499"><sup>[499]</sup></a> <!-- Page 125
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page125"></a>[125]</span>His date is
  rather closely fixed by the fact that he dedicated a work to Raimund who
  was archbishop of Toledo between 1130 and 1150.<a name="NtA_500"
  href="#Nt_500"><sup>[500]</sup></a> His interests were chiefly in the
  translation of Arabic works, especially such as bore upon the
  Aristotelian philosophy. From the standpoint of arithmetic, however, the
  chief interest centers about a manuscript entitled <i>Joannis Hispalensis
  liber Algorismi de Practica Arismetrice</i> which Boncompagni found in
  what is now the <i>Bibliothèque nationale</i> at Paris. Although this
  distinctly lays claim to being Al-Khow&#x101;razm&#x12B;'s work,<a
  name="NtA_501" href="#Nt_501"><sup>[501]</sup></a> the evidence is
  altogether against the statement,<a name="NtA_502"
  href="#Nt_502"><sup>[502]</sup></a> but the book is quite as valuable,
  since it represents the knowledge of the time in which it was written. It
  relates to the operations with integers and sexagesimal fractions,
  including roots, and contains no applications.<a name="NtA_503"
  href="#Nt_503"><sup>[503]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Contemporary with John of Luna, and also living in Toledo, was Gherard
  of Cremona,<a name="NtA_504" href="#Nt_504"><sup>[504]</sup></a> who has
  sometimes been identified, but erroneously, with Gernardus,<a
  name="NtA_505" href="#Nt_505"><sup>[505]</sup></a> the <!-- Page 126
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page126"></a>[126]</span>author of a
  work on algorism. He was a physician, an astronomer, and a mathematician,
  translating from the Arabic both in Italy and in Spain. In arithmetic he
  was influential in spreading the ideas of algorism.</p>

  <p>Four Englishmen&mdash;Adelhard of Bath (c. 1130), Robert of Chester
  (Robertus Cestrensis, c. 1143), William Shelley, and Daniel Morley
  (1180)&mdash;are known<a name="NtA_506"
  href="#Nt_506"><sup>[506]</sup></a> to have journeyed to Spain in the
  twelfth century for the purpose of studying mathematics and Arabic.
  Adelhard of Bath made translations from Arabic into Latin of
  Al-Khow&#x101;razm&#x12B;'s astronomical tables<a name="NtA_507"
  href="#Nt_507"><sup>[507]</sup></a> and of Euclid's Elements,<a
  name="NtA_508" href="#Nt_508"><sup>[508]</sup></a> while Robert of
  Chester is known as the translator of Al-Khow&#x101;razm&#x12B;'s
  algebra.<a name="NtA_509" href="#Nt_509"><sup>[509]</sup></a> There is no
  reason to doubt that all of these men, and others, were familiar with the
  numerals which the Arabs were using.</p>

  <p>The earliest trace we have of computation with Hindu numerals in
  Germany is in an Algorismus of 1143, now in the Hofbibliothek in
  Vienna.<a name="NtA_510" href="#Nt_510"><sup>[510]</sup></a> It is bound
  in with a <!-- Page 127 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page127"></a>[127]</span><i>Computus</i> by the same author and
  bearing the date given. It contains chapters "De additione," "De
  diminutione," "De mediatione," "De divisione," and part of a chapter on
  multiplication. The numerals are in the usual medieval forms except the 2
  which, as will be seen from the illustration,<a name="NtA_511"
  href="#Nt_511"><sup>[511]</sup></a> is somewhat different, and the 3,
  which takes the peculiar shape <a href="images/133a.png"><img
  src="images/133a.png" class="middle" style="height:2ex" alt="Symbol"
  /></a>, a form characteristic of the twelfth century.</p>

  <p>It was about the same time that the <i>Sefer ha-Mispar</i>,<a
  name="NtA_512" href="#Nt_512"><sup>[512]</sup></a> the Book of Number,
  appeared in the Hebrew language. The author, Rabbi Abraham ibn Meïr ibn
  Ezra,<a name="NtA_513" href="#Nt_513"><sup>[513]</sup></a> was born in
  Toledo (c. 1092). In 1139 he went to Egypt, Palestine, and the Orient,
  spending also some years in Italy. Later he lived in southern France and
  in England. He died in 1167. The probability is that he acquired his
  knowledge of the Hindu arithmetic<a name="NtA_514"
  href="#Nt_514"><sup>[514]</sup></a> in his native town of Toledo, but it
  is also likely that the knowledge of other systems which he acquired on
  travels increased his appreciation of this one. We have mentioned the
  fact that he used the first letters of the Hebrew alphabet, <span
  lang="he" class="heb" title="A B G D H W Z CH T`" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5D0;
  &#x5D1; &#x5D2; &#x5D3; &#x5D4; &#x5D5; &#x5D6; &#x5D7;
  &#x5D8;</bdo></span>, for the numerals 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1, and a circle
  for the zero. The quotation in the note given below shows that he knew of
  the Hindu origin; but in his manuscript, although he set down the Hindu
  forms, he used the above nine Hebrew letters with place value for all
  computations.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>

<p class="cenhead">THE SPREAD OF THE NUMERALS IN EUROPE</p>

  <p>Of all the medieval writers, probably the one most influential in
  introducing the new numerals to the scholars of Europe was Leonardo
  Fibonacci, of Pisa.<a name="NtA_515" href="#Nt_515"><sup>[515]</sup></a>
  This remarkable man, the most noteworthy mathematical genius of the
  Middle Ages, was born at Pisa about 1175.<a name="NtA_516"
  href="#Nt_516"><sup>[516]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The traveler of to-day may cross the Via Fibonacci on his way to the
  Campo Santo, and there he may see at the end of the long corridor, across
  the quadrangle, the statue of Leonardo in scholars garb. Few towns have
  honored a mathematician more, and few mathematicians have so distinctly
  honored their birthplace. Leonardo was born in the golden age of this
  city, the period of its commercial, religious, and intellectual
  prosperity.<a name="NtA_517" href="#Nt_517"><sup>[517]</sup></a> <!--
  Page 129 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page129"></a>[129]</span>Situated practically at the mouth of the
  Arno, Pisa formed with Genoa and Venice the trio of the greatest
  commercial centers of Italy at the opening of the thirteenth century.
  Even before Venice had captured the Levantine trade, Pisa had close
  relations with the East. An old Latin chronicle relates that in 1005
  "Pisa was captured by the Saracens," that in the following year "the
  Pisans overthrew the Saracens at Reggio," and that in 1012 "the Saracens
  came to Pisa and destroyed it." The city soon recovered, however, sending
  no fewer than a hundred and twenty ships to Syria in 1099,<a
  name="NtA_518" href="#Nt_518"><sup>[518]</sup></a> founding a merchant
  colony in Constantinople a few years later,<a name="NtA_519"
  href="#Nt_519"><sup>[519]</sup></a> and meanwhile carrying on an
  interurban warfare in Italy that seemed to stimulate it to great
  activity.<a name="NtA_520" href="#Nt_520"><sup>[520]</sup></a> A writer
  of 1114 tells us that at that time there were many heathen
  people&mdash;Turks, Libyans, Parthians, and Chaldeans&mdash;to be found
  in Pisa. It was in the midst of such wars, in a cosmopolitan and
  commercial town, in a center where literary work was not appreciated,<a
  name="NtA_521" href="#Nt_521"><sup>[521]</sup></a> that the genius of
  Leonardo appears as one of the surprises of history, warning us again
  that "we should draw no horoscope; that we should expect little, for what
  we expect will not come to pass."<a name="NtA_522"
  href="#Nt_522"><sup>[522]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Leonardo's father was one William,<a name="NtA_523"
  href="#Nt_523"><sup>[523]</sup></a> and he had a brother named
  Bonaccingus,<a name="NtA_524" href="#Nt_524"><sup>[524]</sup></a> but
  nothing further is <!-- Page 130 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page130"></a>[130]</span>known of his family. As to Fibonacci, most
  writers<a name="NtA_525" href="#Nt_525"><sup>[525]</sup></a> have assumed
  that his father's name was Bonaccio,<a name="NtA_526"
  href="#Nt_526"><sup>[526]</sup></a> whence <i>filius Bonaccii</i>, or
  Fibonacci. Others<a name="NtA_527" href="#Nt_527"><sup>[527]</sup></a>
  believe that the name, even in the Latin form of <i>filius Bonaccii</i>
  as used in Leonardo's work, was simply a general one, like our Johnson or
  Bronson (Brown's son); and the only contemporary evidence that we have
  bears out this view. As to the name Bigollo, used by Leonardo, some have
  thought it a self-assumed one meaning blockhead, a term that had been
  applied to him by the commercial world or possibly by the university
  circle, and taken by him that he might prove what a blockhead could do.
  Milanesi,<a name="NtA_528" href="#Nt_528"><sup>[528]</sup></a> however,
  has shown that the word Bigollo (or Pigollo) was used in Tuscany to mean
  a traveler, and was naturally assumed by one who had studied, as Leonardo
  had, in foreign lands.</p>

  <p>Leonardo's father was a commercial agent at Bugia, the modern
  Bougie,<a name="NtA_529" href="#Nt_529"><sup>[529]</sup></a> the ancient
  Saldae on the coast of Barbary,<a name="NtA_530"
  href="#Nt_530"><sup>[530]</sup></a> a royal capital under the Vandals and
  again, a century before Leonardo, under the Beni Hammad. It had one of
  the best harbors on the coast, sheltered as it is by Mt. Lalla Guraia,<a
  name="NtA_531" href="#Nt_531"><sup>[531]</sup></a> and at the close of
  the twelfth century it was a center of African commerce. It was here that
  Leonardo was taken as a child, and here he went to school to a Moorish
  master. When he reached the years of young manhood he started on a tour
  of the Mediterranean Sea, and visited Egypt, Syria, Greece, Sicily, and
  Provence, meeting with scholars as well as with <!-- Page 131 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page131"></a>[131]</span>merchants, and imbibing
  a knowledge of the various systems of numbers in use in the centers of
  trade. All these systems, however, he says he counted almost as errors
  compared with that of the Hindus.<a name="NtA_532"
  href="#Nt_532"><sup>[532]</sup></a> Returning to Pisa, he wrote his
  <i>Liber Abaci</i><a name="NtA_533" href="#Nt_533"><sup>[533]</sup></a>
  in 1202, rewriting it in 1228.<a name="NtA_534"
  href="#Nt_534"><sup>[534]</sup></a> In this work the numerals are
  explained and are used in the usual computations of business. Such a
  treatise was not destined to be popular, however, because it was too
  advanced for the mercantile class, and too novel for the conservative
  university circles. Indeed, at this time mathematics had only slight
  place in the newly established universities, as witness the oldest known
  statute of the Sorbonne at Paris, dated 1215, where the subject is
  referred to only in an incidental way.<a name="NtA_535"
  href="#Nt_535"><sup>[535]</sup></a> The period was one of great
  commercial activity, and on this very <!-- Page 132 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page132"></a>[132]</span>account such a book
  would attract even less attention than usual.<a name="NtA_536"
  href="#Nt_536"><sup>[536]</sup></a></p>

  <p>It would now be thought that the western world would at once adopt the
  new numerals which Leonardo had made known, and which were so much
  superior to anything that had been in use in Christian Europe. The
  antagonism of the universities would avail but little, it would seem,
  against such an improvement. It must be remembered, however, that there
  was great difficulty in spreading knowledge at this time, some two
  hundred and fifty years before printing was invented. "Popes and princes
  and even great religious institutions possessed far fewer books than many
  farmers of the present age. The library belonging to the Cathedral Church
  of San Martino at Lucca in the ninth century contained only nineteen
  volumes of abridgments from ecclesiastical commentaries."<a
  name="NtA_537" href="#Nt_537"><sup>[537]</sup></a> Indeed, it was not
  until the early part of the fifteenth century that Palla degli Strozzi
  took steps to carry out the project that had been in the mind of
  Petrarch, the founding of a public library. It was largely by word of
  mouth, therefore, that this early knowledge had to be transmitted.
  Fortunately the presence of foreign students in Italy at this time made
  this transmission feasible. (If human nature was the same then as now, it
  is not impossible that the very opposition of the faculties to the works
  of Leonardo led the students to investigate <!-- Page 133 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page133"></a>[133]</span>them the more
  zealously.) At Vicenza in 1209, for example, there were Bohemians, Poles,
  Frenchmen, Burgundians, Germans, and Spaniards, not to speak of
  representatives of divers towns of Italy; and what was true there was
  also true of other intellectual centers. The knowledge could not fail to
  spread, therefore, and as a matter of fact we find numerous bits of
  evidence that this was the case. Although the bankers of Florence were
  forbidden to use these numerals in 1299, and the statutes of the
  university of Padua required stationers to keep the price lists of books
  "non per cifras, sed per literas claros,"<a name="NtA_538"
  href="#Nt_538"><sup>[538]</sup></a> the numerals really made much headway
  from about 1275 on.</p>

  <p>It was, however, rather exceptional for the common people of Germany
  to use the Arabic numerals before the sixteenth century, a good witness
  to this fact being the popular almanacs. Calendars of 1457-1496<a
  name="NtA_539" href="#Nt_539"><sup>[539]</sup></a> have generally the
  Roman numerals, while Köbel's calendar of 1518 gives the Arabic forms as
  subordinate to the Roman. In the register of the Kreuzschule at Dresden
  the Roman forms were used even until 1539.</p>

  <p>While not minimizing the importance of the scientific work of Leonardo
  of Pisa, we may note that the more popular treatises by Alexander de
  Villa Dei (c. 1240 <span class="scac">A.D.</span>) and John of Halifax
  (Sacrobosco, c. 1250 <span class="scac">A.D.</span>) were much more
  widely used, and doubtless contributed more to the spread of the numerals
  among the common people.</p>

<p><!-- Page 134 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page134"></a>[134]</span></p>

  <p>The <i>Carmen de Algorismo</i><a name="NtA_540"
  href="#Nt_540"><sup>[540]</sup></a> of Alexander de Villa Dei was written
  in verse, as indeed were many other textbooks of that time. That it was
  widely used is evidenced by the large number of manuscripts<a
  name="NtA_541" href="#Nt_541"><sup>[541]</sup></a> extant in European
  libraries. Sacrobosco's <i>Algorismus</i>,<a name="NtA_542"
  href="#Nt_542"><sup>[542]</sup></a> in which some lines from the Carmen
  are quoted, enjoyed a wide popularity as a textbook for university
  instruction.<a name="NtA_543" href="#Nt_543"><sup>[543]</sup></a> The
  work was evidently written with this end in view, as numerous
  commentaries by university lecturers are found. Probably the most widely
  used of these was that of Petrus de Dacia<a name="NtA_544"
  href="#Nt_544"><sup>[544]</sup></a> written in 1291. These works throw an
  interesting light upon the method of instruction in mathematics in use in
  the universities from the thirteenth even to the sixteenth century.
  Evidently the text was first read and copied by students.<a
  name="NtA_545" href="#Nt_545"><sup>[545]</sup></a> Following this came
  line by line an exposition of the text, such as is given in Petrus de
  Dacia's commentary.</p>

  <p>Sacrobosco's work is of interest also because it was probably due to
  the extended use of this work that the <!-- Page 135 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page135"></a>[135]</span>term <i>Arabic
  numerals</i> became common. In two places there is mention of the
  inventors of this system. In the introduction it is stated that this
  science of reckoning was due to a philosopher named Algus, whence the
  name <i>algorismus</i>,<a name="NtA_546"
  href="#Nt_546"><sup>[546]</sup></a> and in the section on numeration
  reference is made to the Arabs as the inventors of this science.<a
  name="NtA_547" href="#Nt_547"><sup>[547]</sup></a> While some of the
  commentators, Petrus de Dacia<a name="NtA_548"
  href="#Nt_548"><sup>[548]</sup></a> among them, knew of the Hindu origin,
  most of them undoubtedly took the text as it stood; and so the Arabs were
  credited with the invention of the system.</p>

  <p>The first definite trace that we have of an algorism in the French
  language is found in a manuscript written about 1275.<a name="NtA_549"
  href="#Nt_549"><sup>[549]</sup></a> This interesting leaf, for the part
  on algorism consists of a single folio, was noticed by the Abbé
  Leb&oelig;uf as early as 1741,<a name="NtA_550"
  href="#Nt_550"><sup>[550]</sup></a> and by Daunou in 1824.<a
  name="NtA_551" href="#Nt_551"><sup>[551]</sup></a> It then seems to have
  been lost in the multitude of Paris manuscripts; for although Chasles<a
  name="NtA_552" href="#Nt_552"><sup>[552]</sup></a> relates his vain
  search for it, it was not rediscovered until 1882. In that year M. Ch.
  Henry found it, and to his care we owe our knowledge of the interesting
  manuscript. The work is anonymous and is devoted almost entirely to
  geometry, only <!-- Page 136 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page136"></a>[136]</span>two pages (one folio) relating to
  arithmetic. In these the forms of the numerals are given, and a very
  brief statement as to the operations, it being evident that the writer
  himself had only the slightest understanding of the subject.</p>

  <p>Once the new system was known in France, even thus superficially, it
  would be passed across the Channel to England. Higden,<a name="NtA_553"
  href="#Nt_553"><sup>[553]</sup></a> writing soon after the opening of the
  fourteenth century, speaks of the French influence at that time and for
  some generations preceding:<a name="NtA_554"
  href="#Nt_554"><sup>[554]</sup></a> "For two hundred years children in
  scole, agenst the usage and manir of all other nations beeth compelled
  for to leave hire own language, and for to construe hir lessons and hire
  thynges in Frensche.... Gentilmen children beeth taught to speke Frensche
  from the tyme that they bith rokked in hir cradell; and uplondissche men
  will likne himself to gentylmen, and fondeth with greet besynesse for to
  speke Frensche."</p>

  <p>The question is often asked, why did not these new numerals attract
  more immediate attention? Why did they have to wait until the sixteenth
  century to be generally used in business and in the schools? In reply it
  may be said that in their elementary work the schools always wait upon
  the demands of trade. That work which pretends to touch the life of the
  people must come reasonably near doing so. Now the computations of
  business until about 1500 did not demand the new figures, for two
  reasons: First, cheap paper was not known. Paper-making of any kind was
  not introduced into Europe until <!-- Page 137 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page137"></a>[137]</span>the twelfth century,
  and cheap paper is a product of the nineteenth. Pencils, too, of the
  modern type, date only from the sixteenth century. In the second place,
  modern methods of operating, particularly of multiplying and dividing
  (operations of relatively greater importance when all measures were in
  compound numbers requiring reductions at every step), were not yet
  invented. The old plan required the erasing of figures after they had
  served their purpose, an operation very simple with counters, since they
  could be removed. The new plan did not as easily permit this. Hence we
  find the new numerals very tardily admitted to the counting-house, and
  not welcomed with any enthusiasm by teachers.<a name="NtA_555"
  href="#Nt_555"><sup>[555]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Aside from their use in the early treatises on the new art of
  reckoning, the numerals appeared from time to time in the dating of
  manuscripts and upon monuments. The oldest definitely dated European
  document known <!-- Page 138 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page138"></a>[138]</span>to contain the numerals is a Latin
  manuscript,<a name="NtA_556" href="#Nt_556"><sup>[556]</sup></a> the
  Codex Vigilanus, written in the Albelda Cloister not far from Logroño in
  Spain, in 976 <span class="scac">A.D.</span> The nine characters (of
  &#x121;ob&#x101;r type), without the zero, are given as an addition to
  the first chapters of the third book of the <i>Origines</i> by Isidorus
  of Seville, in which the Roman numerals are under discussion. Another
  Spanish copy of the same work, of 992 <span class="scac">A.D.</span>,
  contains the numerals in the corresponding section. The writer ascribes
  an Indian origin to them in the following words: "Item de figuris
  arithmetic&#x119;. Scire debemus in Indos subtilissimum ingenium habere
  et ceteras gentes eis in arithmetica et geometria et ceteris liberalibus
  disciplinis concedere. Et hoc manifestum est in nobem figuris, quibus
  designant unumquemque gradum cuiuslibet gradus. Quarum hec sunt forma."
  The nine &#x121;ob&#x101;r characters follow. Some of the abacus forms<a
  name="NtA_557" href="#Nt_557"><sup>[557]</sup></a> previously given are
  doubtless also of the tenth century. The earliest Arabic documents
  containing the numerals are two manuscripts of 874 and 888 <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span><a name="NtA_558"
  href="#Nt_558"><sup>[558]</sup></a> They appear about a century later in
  a work<a name="NtA_559" href="#Nt_559"><sup>[559]</sup></a> written at
  Shiraz in 970 <span class="scac">A.D.</span> There is also an early trace
  of their use on a pillar recently discovered in a church apparently
  destroyed as early as the tenth century, not far from the Jeremias
  Monastery, in Egypt. <!-- Page 139 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page139"></a>[139]</span>A graffito in Arabic on this pillar has
  the date 349 <span class="scac">A.H.</span>, which corresponds to 961
  <span class="scac">A.D.</span><a name="NtA_560"
  href="#Nt_560"><sup>[560]</sup></a> For the dating of Latin documents the
  Arabic forms were used as early as the thirteenth century.<a
  name="NtA_561" href="#Nt_561"><sup>[561]</sup></a></p>

  <p>On the early use of these numerals in Europe the only scientific study
  worthy the name is that made by Mr. G. F. Hill of the British Museum.<a
  name="NtA_562" href="#Nt_562"><sup>[562]</sup></a> From his
  investigations it appears that the earliest occurrence of a date in these
  numerals on a coin is found in the reign of Roger of Sicily in 1138.<a
  name="NtA_563" href="#Nt_563"><sup>[563]</sup></a> Until recently it was
  thought that the earliest such date was 1217 <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> for an Arabic piece and 1388 for a Turkish
  one.<a name="NtA_564" href="#Nt_564"><sup>[564]</sup></a> Most of the
  seals and medals containing dates that were at one time thought to be
  very early have been shown by Mr. Hill to be of relatively late
  workmanship. There are, however, in European manuscripts, numerous
  instances of the use of these numerals before the twelfth century.
  Besides the example in the Codex Vigilanus, another of the tenth century
  has been found in the St. Gall MS. now in the University Library at
  Zürich, the forms differing materially from those in the Spanish
  codex.</p>

  <p>The third specimen in point of time in Mr. Hill's list is from a
  Vatican MS. of 1077. The fourth and fifth specimens are from the Erlangen
  MS. of Boethius, of the same <!-- Page 140 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page140"></a>[140]</span>(eleventh) century, and the sixth and
  seventh are also from an eleventh-century MS. of Boethius at Chartres.
  These and other early forms are given by Mr. Hill in this table, which is
  reproduced with his kind permission.</p>

  <p>This is one of more than fifty tables given in Mr. Hill's valuable

  class="pagenum"><a name="page141"></a>[141]</span>are referred for
  details as to the development of number-forms in Europe from the tenth to
  the sixteenth century. It is of interest to add that he has found that
  among the earliest dates of European coins or medals in these numerals,
  after the Sicilian one already mentioned, are the following: Austria,
  1484; Germany, 1489 (Cologne); Switzerland, 1424 (St. Gall); Netherlands,
  1474; France, 1485; Italy, 1390.<a name="NtA_565"
  href="#Nt_565"><sup>[565]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The earliest English coin dated in these numerals was struck in
  1551,<a name="NtA_566" href="#Nt_566"><sup>[566]</sup></a> although there
  is a Scotch piece of 1539.<a name="NtA_567"
  href="#Nt_567"><sup>[567]</sup></a> In numbering pages of a printed book
  these numerals were first used in a work of Petrarch's published at
  Cologne in 1471.<a name="NtA_568" href="#Nt_568"><sup>[568]</sup></a> The
  date is given in the following form in the <i>Biblia Pauperum</i>,<a

  <p>while in another block-book which possibly goes back to c. 1430<a

  several illustrations, with forms as follows:</p>

  <p>Many printed works anterior to 1471 have pages or chapters numbered by
  hand, but many of these numerals are <!-- Page 142 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page142"></a>[142]</span>of date much later than
  the printing of the work. Other works were probably numbered directly
  after printing. Thus the chapters 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 in a book of 1470<a
  name="NtA_571" href="#Nt_571"><sup>[571]</sup></a> are numbered as
  follows: Capitulem <a href="images/148a.png"><img src="images/148a.png"

  followed by Roman numerals. This appears in the body of the text, in
  spaces left by the printer to be filled in by hand. Another book<a
  name="NtA_572" href="#Nt_572"><sup>[572]</sup></a> of 1470 has pages
  numbered by hand with a mixture of Roman and Hindu numerals, thus,</p>

  <p>As to monumental inscriptions,<a name="NtA_573"

  <p>As to the forms of the numerals, fashion played a leading part until

  it is often difficult for a foreigner to distinguish between the 3 and 5
  of the French types.</p>

  <p>As to the particular numerals, the following are some of the forms to
  be found in the later manuscripts and in the early printed books.</p>

  <p>1. In the early printed books "one" was often i, perhaps to save
  types, just as some modern typewriters use the same character for l and
  1.<a name="NtA_587" href="#Nt_587"><sup>[587]</sup></a> In the
  manuscripts the "one" appears in such forms as<a name="NtA_588"
  href="#Nt_588"><sup>[588]</sup></a></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:36%;">
      <a href="images/151a.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/151a.png"
      alt="Variations of 1." title="Variations of 1." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>2. "Two" often appears as z in the early printed books, 12 appearing
  as iz.<a name="NtA_589" href="#Nt_589"><sup>[589]</sup></a> In the
  medieval manuscripts the following forms are common:<a name="NtA_590"
  href="#Nt_590"><sup>[590]</sup></a></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:50%;">
      <a href="images/151b.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/151b.png"
      alt="Variations of 2." title="Variations of 2." /></a>
  </div>
<p><!-- Page 146 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page146"></a>[146]</span></p>

  <p>It is evident, from the early traces, that it is merely a cursive form
  for the primitive <a href="images/033f.png"><img src="images/033f.png"
  class="middle" style="height:1.5ex" alt="2 horizontal strokes" /></a>,
  just as 3 comes from <a href="images/033h.png"><img src="images/033h.png"
  class="middle" style="height:1.5ex" alt="3 horizontal strokes" /></a>, as
  in the N&#x101;n&#x101; Gh&#x101;t inscriptions.</p>

  <p>3. "Three" usually had a special type in the first printed books,
  although occasionally it appears as <a href="images/152a.png"><img
  src="images/152a.png" class="middle" style="height:2ex" alt="Symbol"
  /></a>.<a name="NtA_591" href="#Nt_591"><sup>[591]</sup></a> In the
  medieval manuscripts it varied rather less than most of the others. The
  following are common forms:<a name="NtA_592"
  href="#Nt_592"><sup>[592]</sup></a></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:48%;">
      <a href="images/152b.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/152b.png"
      alt="Variations of 3." title="Variations of 3." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>4. "Four" has changed greatly; and one of the first tests as to the
  age of a manuscript on arithmetic, and the place where it was written, is
  the examination of this numeral. Until the time of printing the most
  common form was <a href="images/152c.png"><img src="images/152c.png"
  class="middle" style="height:2ex" alt="Symbol" /></a>, although the
  Florentine manuscript of Leonard of Pisa's work has the form <a
  href="images/152d.png"><img src="images/152d.png" class="middle"
  style="height:2ex" alt="Symbol" /></a>;<a name="NtA_593"
  href="#Nt_593"><sup>[593]</sup></a> but the manuscripts show that the
  Florentine arithmeticians and astronomers rather early began to
  straighten the first of these forms up to forms like <a
  href="images/152e.png"><img src="images/152e.png" class="middle"
  style="height:2ex" alt="Symbol" /></a><a name="NtA_594"
  href="#Nt_594"><sup>[594]</sup></a> and <a href="images/152f.png"><img
  src="images/152f.png" class="middle" style="height:2ex" alt="Symbol"
  /></a><a href="#Nt_594"><sup>[594]</sup></a> or <a
  href="images/152g.png"><img src="images/152g.png" class="middle"
  style="height:2ex" alt="Symbol" /></a>,<a name="NtA_595"
  href="#Nt_595"><sup>[595]</sup></a> more closely resembling our own. The
  first printed books generally used our present form<a name="NtA_596"
  href="#Nt_596"><sup>[596]</sup></a> with the closed top <a
  href="images/152h.png"><img src="images/152h.png" class="middle"
  style="height:2ex" alt="Symbol" /></a>, the open top used in writing ( <a
  href="images/152i.png"><img src="images/152i.png" class="middle"
  style="height:2ex" alt="Symbol" /></a>) being <!-- Page 147 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page147"></a>[147]</span>purely modern. The
  following are other forms of the four, from various manuscripts:<a
  name="NtA_597" href="#Nt_597"><sup>[597]</sup></a></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:50%;">
      <a href="images/153a.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/153a.png"
      alt="Variations of 4." title="Variations of 4." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>5. "Five" also varied greatly before the time of printing. The
  following are some of the forms:<a name="NtA_598"
  href="#Nt_598"><sup>[598]</sup></a></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:42%;">
      <a href="images/153b.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/153b.png"
      alt="Variations of 5." title="Variations of 5." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>6. "Six" has changed rather less than most of the others. The chief
  variation has been in the slope of the top, as will be seen in the
  following:<a name="NtA_599" href="#Nt_599"><sup>[599]</sup></a></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:30%;">
      <a href="images/153c.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/153c.png"
      alt="Variations of 6." title="Variations of 6." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>7. "Seven," like "four," has assumed its present erect form only since
  the fifteenth century. In medieval times it appeared as follows:<a
  name="NtA_600" href="#Nt_600"><sup>[600]</sup></a></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:52%;">
      <a href="images/153d.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/153d.png"
      alt="Variations of 7." title="Variations of 7." /></a>
  </div>
<p><!-- Page 148 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page148"></a>[148]</span></p>

  <p>8. "Eight," like "six," has changed but little. In medieval times
  there are a few variants of interest as follows:<a name="NtA_601"
  href="#Nt_601"><sup>[601]</sup></a></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:20%;">
      <a href="images/154a.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/154a.png"
      alt="Variations of 8." title="Variations of 8." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>In the sixteenth century, however, there was manifested a tendency to
  write it <a href="images/154b.png"><img src="images/154b.png"
  class="middle" style="height:1.5ex" alt="Symbol" /></a>.<a name="NtA_602"
  href="#Nt_602"><sup>[602]</sup></a></p>

  <p>9. "Nine" has not varied as much as most of the others. Among the
  medieval forms are the following:<a name="NtA_603"
  href="#Nt_603"><sup>[603]</sup></a></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:45%;">
      <a href="images/154c.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/154c.png"
      alt="Variations of 9." title="Variations of 9." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>0. The shape of the zero also had a varied history. The following are
  common medieval forms:<a name="NtA_604"
  href="#Nt_604"><sup>[604]</sup></a></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:30%;">
      <a href="images/154d.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/154d.png"
      alt="Variations of 0." title="Variations of 0." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>The explanation of the place value was a serious matter to most of the
  early writers. If they had been using an abacus constructed like the
  Russian chotü, and had placed this before all learners of the positional
  system, there would have been little trouble. But the medieval <!-- Page
  149 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page149"></a>[149]</span>line-reckoning, where the lines stood for
  powers of 10 and the spaces for half of such powers, did not lend itself
  to this comparison. Accordingly we find such labored explanations as the
  following, from <i>The Crafte of Nombrynge</i>:</p>

  <p>"Euery of these figuris bitokens hym selfe &amp; no more, yf he stonde
  in the first place of the rewele....</p>

  <p>"If it stonde in the secunde place of the rewle, he betokens ten tymes
  hym selfe, as this figure 2 here 20 tokens ten tyme hym selfe, that is
  twenty, for he hym selfe betokens tweyne, &amp; ten tymes twene is
  twenty. And for he stondis on the lyft side &amp; in the secunde place,
  he betokens ten tyme hym selfe. And so go forth....</p>

  <p>"Nil cifra significat sed dat signare sequenti. Expone this verse. A
  cifre tokens no&#x21D;t, bot he makes the figure to betoken that comes
  after hym more than he shuld &amp; he were away, as thus 10. here the
  figure of one tokens ten, &amp; yf the cifre were away &amp; no figure
  byfore hym he schuld token bot one, for than he schuld stonde in the
  first place...."<a name="NtA_605" href="#Nt_605"><sup>[605]</sup></a></p>

  <p>It would seem that a system that was thus used for dating documents,
  coins, and monuments, would have been generally adopted much earlier than
  it was, particularly in those countries north of Italy where it did not
  come into general use until the sixteenth century. This, however, has
  been the fate of many inventions, as witness our neglect of logarithms
  and of contracted processes to-day.</p>

  <p>As to Germany, the fifteenth century saw the rise of the new
  symbolism; the sixteenth century saw it slowly <!-- Page 150 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page150"></a>[150]</span>gain the mastery; the
  seventeenth century saw it finally conquer the system that for two
  thousand years had dominated the arithmetic of business. Not a little of
  the success of the new plan was due to Luther's demand that all learning
  should go into the vernacular.<a name="NtA_606"
  href="#Nt_606"><sup>[606]</sup></a></p>

  <p>During the transition period from the Roman to the Arabic numerals,
  various anomalous forms found place. For example, we have in the
  fourteenth century c<span class="grk">&alpha;</span> for 104;<a
  name="NtA_607" href="#Nt_607"><sup>[607]</sup></a> 1000. 300. 80 et 4 for
  1384;<a name="NtA_608" href="#Nt_608"><sup>[608]</sup></a> and in a
  manuscript of the fifteenth century 12901 for 1291.<a name="NtA_609"
  href="#Nt_609"><sup>[609]</sup></a> In the same century m. cccc. 8II
  appears for 1482,<a name="NtA_610" href="#Nt_610"><sup>[610]</sup></a>
  while M<sup>o</sup>CCCC<sup>o</sup>50 (1450) and MCCCCXL6 (1446) are used
  by Theodoricus Ruffi about the same time.<a name="NtA_611"
  href="#Nt_611"><sup>[611]</sup></a> To the next century belongs the form
  1vojj for 1502. Even in Sfortunati's <i>Nuovo lume</i><a name="NtA_612"
  href="#Nt_612"><sup>[612]</sup></a> the use of ordinals is quite
  confused, the propositions on a single page being numbered "tertia," "4,"
  and "V."</p>

  <p>Although not connected with the Arabic numerals in any direct way, the
  medieval astrological numerals may here be mentioned. These are given by
  several early writers, but notably by Noviomagus (1539),<a name="NtA_613"
  href="#Nt_613"><sup>[613]</sup></a> as follows<a name="NtA_614"
  href="#Nt_614"><sup>[614]</sup></a>:</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:52%;">
      <a href="images/156a.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/156a.png"
      alt="Astrological numerals." title="Astrological numerals." /></a>
  </div>
<p><!-- Page 151 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page151"></a>[151]</span></p>

  <p>Thus we find the numerals gradually replacing the Roman forms all over
  Europe, from the time of Leonardo of Pisa until the seventeenth century.
  But in the Far East to-day they are quite unknown in many countries, and
  they still have their way to make. In many parts of India, among the
  common people of Japan and China, in Siam and generally about the Malay
  Peninsula, in Tibet, and among the East India islands, the natives still
  adhere to their own numeral forms. Only as Western civilization is making
  its way into the commercial life of the East do the numerals as used by
  us find place, save as the Sanskrit forms appear in parts of India. It is
  therefore with surprise that the student of mathematics comes to realize
  how modern are these forms so common in the West, how limited is their
  use even at the present time, and how slow the world has been and is in
  adopting such a simple device as the Hindu-Arabic numerals.</p>

<h3>WENTWORTH'S</h3>

<h2>COLLEGE ALGEBRA</h2>

<p class="cenhead">REVISED EDITION</p>

<p class="cenhead">12mo. Half morocco. 530 pages. List price, $1.50; mailing price, $1.65</p>

<hr class="short" >

  <p>This book is a thorough revision of the author's "College Algebra."
  Some chapters of the old edition have been wholly rewritten, and the
  other chapters have been rewritten in part and greatly improved. The
  order of topics has been changed to a certain extent; the plan is to have
  each chapter as complete in itself as possible, so that the teacher may
  vary the order of succession at his discretion.</p>

  <p>As the name implies, the work is intended for colleges and scientific
  schools. The first part is simply a review of the principles of algebra
  preceding Quadratic Equations, with just enough examples to illustrate
  and enforce these principles. By this brief treatment of the first
  chapters sufficient space is allowed, without making the book cumbersome,
  for a full discussion of Quadratic Equations, The Binomial Theorem,
  Choice Chance, Series, Determinants, and the General Properties of
  Equations.</p>

  <p>Every effort has been made to present in the clearest light each
  subject discussed, and to give in matter and methods the best training in
  algebraic analysis at present attainable.</p>

<h2>ALGEBRA FOR BEGINNERS</h2>

<p class="cenhead">By DAVID EUGENE SMITH,</p>

<p class="cenhead">Professor of Mathematics in Teachers College, Columbia University</p>

<hr class="short" >

<p class="cenhead">12mo, cloth, 154 pages, 50 cents</p>

<hr class="short" >

  <p>This work is intended to serve as an introduction to the study of
  algebra, and is adapted to the needs of the seventh or eighth school
  year. It is arranged in harmony with the leading courses of study that
  include algebra in the curriculum of the grades.</p>

  <p>The relation of algebra to arithmetic is emphasized, the subject is
  treated topically, and each important point is touched at least twice.
  The book begins by showing the uses of algebra, employing such practical
  applications as are within the pupil's range of knowledge. When an
  interest has thus been awakened in the subject, the fundamental
  operations are presented with the simple explanations necessary to make
  the student independent of dogmatic rules. Throughout the book abundant
  oral and written drill exercises are provided. The work includes linear
  equations with two unknown quantities, and easy quadratics.</p>

  <p>The leading features may be summarized as follows: (1) an arrangement
  in harmony with existing courses of study; (2) a presentation designed to
  awaken the interest of the pupils; (3) a topical arrangement for each
  half year, every important topic being repeated; (4) simplicity of
  explanations; (5) development of the relation of algebra to arithmetic
  both in theory and in applications; (6) emphasis laid on the importance
  of oral as well as written algebra.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_1" href="#NtA_1">[1]</a> "<i>Discipulus.</i> Quis primus
  invenit numerum apud Hebræos et Ægyptios? <i>Magister.</i> Abraham primus
  invenit numerum apud Hebræos, deinde Moses; et Abraham tradidit istam
  scientiam numeri ad Ægyptios, et docuit eos: deinde Josephus." [Bede,
  <i>De computo dialogus</i> (doubtfully assigned to him), <i>Opera
  omnia</i>, Paris, 1862, Vol. I, p. 650.]</p>

  <p>"Alii referunt ad Ph&oelig;nices inventores arithmeticæ, propter
  eandem commerciorum caussam: Alii ad Indos: Ioannes de Sacrobosco, cujus
  sepulchrum est Lutetiæ in comitio Maturinensi, refert ad Arabes." [Ramus,
  <i>Arithmeticæ libri dvo</i>, Basel, 1569, p. 112.]</p>

  <p>Similar notes are given by Peletarius in his commentary on the
  arithmetic of Gemma Frisius (1563 ed., fol. 77), and in his own work
  (1570 Lyons ed., p. 14): "La valeur des Figures commence au coste dextre
  tirant vers le coste senestre: au rebours de notre maniere d'escrire par
  ce que la premiere prattique est venue des Chaldees: ou des Pheniciens,
  qui ont été les premiers traffiquers de marchandise."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_2" href="#NtA_2">[2]</a> Maximus Planudes (c. 1330) states
  that "the nine symbols come from the Indians." [Wäschke's German
  translation, Halle, 1878, p. 3.] Willichius speaks of the "Zyphræ
  Indicæ," in his <i>Arithmeticæ libri tres</i> (Strasburg, 1540, p. 93),
  and Cataneo of "le noue figure de gli Indi," in his <i>Le pratiche delle
  dve prime mathematiche</i> (Venice, 1546, fol. 1). Woepcke is not
  correct, therefore, in saying ("Mémoire sur la propagation des chiffres
  indiens," hereafter referred to as <i>Propagation</i> [<i>Journal
  Asiatique</i>, Vol. I (6), 1863, p. 34]) that Wallis (<i>A Treatise on
  Algebra, both historical and practical</i>, London, 1685, p. 13, and
  <i>De algebra tractatus</i>, Latin edition in his <i>Opera omnia</i>,
  1693, Vol. II, p. 10) was one of the first to give the Hindu origin.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_3" href="#NtA_3">[3]</a> From the 1558 edition of <i>The
  Grovnd of Artes</i>, fol. C, 5. Similarly Bishop Tonstall writes: "Qui a
  Chaldeis primum in finitimos, deinde in omnes pene gentes fluxit....
  Numerandi artem a Chaldeis esse profectam: qui dum scribunt, a dextra
  incipiunt, et in leuam progrediuntur." [<i>De arte supputandi</i>,
  London, 1522, fol. B, 3.] Gemma Frisius, the great continental rival of
  Recorde, had the same idea: "Primùm autem appellamus dexterum locum, eo
  quòd haec ars vel à Chaldæis, vel ab Hebræis ortum habere credatur, qui
  etiam eo ordine scribunt"; but this refers more evidently to the Arabic
  numerals. [<i>Arithmeticæ practicæ methodvs facilis</i>, Antwerp, 1540,
  fol. 4 of the 1563 ed.] Sacrobosco (c. 1225) mentions the same thing.
  Even the modern Jewish writers claim that one of their scholars,
  M&#x101;sh&#x101;ll&#x101;h (c. 800), introduced them to the Mohammedan
  world. [C. Levias, <i>The Jewish Encyclopedia</i>, New York, 1905, Vol.
  IX, p. 348.]</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_4" href="#NtA_4">[4]</a> "... &amp; que esto fu trouato di
  fare da gli Arabi con diece figure." [<i>La prima parte del general
  trattato di nvmeri, et misvre</i>, Venice, 1556, fol. 9 of the 1592
  edition.]</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_5" href="#NtA_5">[5]</a> "Vom welchen Arabischen auch disz
  Kunst entsprungen ist." [<i>Ain nerv geordnet Rechenbiechlin</i>,
  Augsburg, 1514, fol. 13 of the 1531 edition. The printer used the letters
  <i>rv</i> for <i>w</i> in "new" in the first edition, as he had no
  <i>w</i> of the proper font.]</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_6" href="#NtA_6">[6]</a> Among them Glareanus:
  "Characteres simplices sunt nouem significatiui, ab Indis usque, siue
  Chaldæis asciti .1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9. Est item unus .0 circulus, qui nihil
  significat." [<i>De VI. Arithmeticae practicae speciebvs</i>, Paris,
  1539, fol. 9 of the 1543 edition.]</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_7" href="#NtA_7">[7]</a> "Barbarische oder gemeine
  Ziffern." [Anonymous, <i>Das Einmahl Eins cum notis variorum</i>,
  Dresden, 1703, p. 3.] So Vossius (<i>De universae matheseos natura et
  constitutione liber</i>, Amsterdam, 1650, p. 34) calls them "Barbaras
  numeri notas." The word at that time was possibly synonymous with
  Arabic.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_8" href="#NtA_8">[8]</a> His full name was
  &#x201B;Ab&#x16B; &#x201B;Abdall&#x101;h <span class="special"
  title="Mohammed">Mo&#x1E25;ammed</span> ibn M&#x16B;s&#x101;
  al-Khow&#x101;razm&#x12B;. He was born in Khow&#x101;rezm, "the
  lowlands," the country about the present Khiva and bordering on the Oxus,
  and lived at Bagdad under the caliph al-M&#x101;m&#x16B;n. He died
  probably between 220 and 230 of the Mohammedan era, that is, between 835
  and 845 <span class="scac">A.D.</span>, although some put the date as
  early as 812. The best account of this great scholar may be found in an
  article by C. Nallino, "<span class="special"
  title="Al-Huwarizmi">Al-&#x1E2A;uw&#x101;rizm&#x12B;</span>" in the
  <i>Atti della R. Accad. dei Lincei</i>, Rome, 1896. See also
  <i>Verhandlungen des 5. Congresses der Orientalisten</i>, Berlin, 1882,
  Vol. II, p. 19; W. Spitta-Bey in the <i>Zeitschrift der deutschen
  Morgenländ. Gesellschaft</i>, Vol. XXXIII, p. 224; Steinschneider in the
  <i>Zeitschrift der deutschen Morgenländ. Gesellschaft</i>, Vol. L, p.
  214; Treutlein in the <i>Abhandlungen zur Geschichte der Mathematik</i>,
  Vol. I, p. 5; Suter, "Die Mathematiker und Astronomen der Araber und ihre
  Werke," <i>Abhandlungen zur Geschichte der Mathematik</i>, Vol. X,
  Leipzig, 1900, p. 10, and "Nachträge," in Vol. XIV, p. 158; Cantor,
  <i>Geschichte der Mathematik</i>, Vol. I, 3d ed., pp. 712-733 etc.; F.
  Woepcke in <i>Propagation</i>, p. 489. So recently has he become known
  that Heilbronner, writing in 1742, merely mentions him as "Ben-Musa,
  inter Arabes celebris Geometra, scripsit de figuris planis &amp;
  sphericis." [<i>Historia matheseos universæ</i>, Leipzig, 1742, p.
  438.]</p>

  <p>In this work most of the Arabic names will be transliterated
  substantially as laid down by Suter in his work <i>Die Mathematiker</i>
  etc., except where this violates English pronunciation. The scheme of
  pronunciation of oriental names is set forth in the preface.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_9" href="#NtA_9">[9]</a> Our word <i>algebra</i> is from
  the title of one of his works, Al-jabr wa'l-muq&#x101;balah, Completion
  and Comparison. The work was translated into English by F. Rosen, London,
  1831, and treated in <i>L'Algèbre d'al-Kh&#x101;rizmi et les méthodes
  indienne et grecque</i>, Léon Rodet, Paris, 1878, extract from the
  <i>Journal Asiatique</i>. For the derivation of the word <i>algebra</i>,
  see Cossali, <i>Scritti Inediti</i>, pp. 381-383, Rome, 1857; Leonardo's
  <i>Liber Abbaci</i> (1202), p. 410, Rome, 1857; both published by B.
  Boncompagni. "Almuchabala" also was used as a name for algebra.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_10" href="#NtA_10">[10]</a> This learned scholar, teacher
  of O'Creat who wrote the <i>Helceph</i> ("<i>Prologus N. Ocreati in
  Helceph ad Adelardum Batensem magistrum suum</i>"), studied in Toledo,
  learned Arabic, traveled as far east as Egypt, and brought from the
  Levant numerous manuscripts for study and translation. See Henry in the
  <i>Abhandlungen zur Geschichte der Mathematik</i>, Vol. III, p. 131;
  Woepcke in <i>Propagation</i>, p. 518.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_11" href="#NtA_11">[11]</a> The title is <i>Algoritmi de
  numero Indorum</i>. That he did not make this translation is asserted by
  Eneström in the <i>Bibliotheca Mathematica</i>, Vol. I (3), p. 520.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_12" href="#NtA_12">[12]</a> Thus he speaks "de numero
  indorum per .IX. literas," and proceeds: "Dixit algoritmi: Cum uidissem
  yndos constituisse .IX. literas in uniuerso numero suo, propter
  dispositionem suam quam posuerunt, uolui patefacere de opera quod fit per
  eas aliquid quod esset leuius discentibus, si deus uoluerit."
  [Boncompagni, <i>Trattati d'Aritmetica</i>,  Rome, 1857.] Discussed by F.
  Woepcke, <i>Sur l'introduction de l'arithmétique indienne en
  Occident</i>, Rome, 1859.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_13" href="#NtA_13">[13]</a> Thus in a commentary by
  &#x201B;Al&#x12B; ibn Ab&#x12B; Bekr ibn al-Jam&#x101;l <span
  class="special" title="al-Ansari">al-An&#x1E63;&#x101;r&#x12B;</span>
  al-Mekk&#x12B; on a treatise on &#x121;ob&#x101;r arithmetic (explained
  later) called <i>Al-murshidah</i>, found by Woepcke in Paris
  (<i>Propagation</i>, p. 66), there is mentioned the fact that there are
  "nine Indian figures" and "a second kind of Indian figures ... although
  these are the figures of the &#x121;ob&#x101;r writing." So in a
  commentary by <span class="special" title="Hosein ibn Mohammed al-Mahalli"
  >&#x1E24;osein ibn Mo&#x1E25;ammed al-Ma&#x1E25;all&#x12B;</span> (died
  in 1756) on the <i><span class="special" title="Mokhtasar fi`ilm el-hisab"
  >Mokhta&#x1E63;ar f&#x12B;&#x201B;ilm el-&#x1E25;is&#x101;b</span></i>
  (Extract from Arithmetic) by &#x201B;Abdalq&#x101;dir ibn
  &#x201B;Al&#x12B; al-Sakh&#x101;w&#x12B; (died c. 1000) it is related
  that "the preface treats of the forms of the figures of Hindu signs, such
  as were established by the Hindu nation." [Woepcke, <i>Propagation</i>,
  p. 63.]</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_58" href="#NtA_58">[58]</a> This problem deserves more
  study than has yet been given it. A beginning may be made with Comte
  Goblet d'Alviella, <i>Ce que l'Inde doit à la Grèce</i>, Paris, 1897, and
  H. G. Keene's review, "The Greeks in India," in the <i>Calcutta
  Review</i>, Vol. CXIV, 1902, p. 1. See also F. Woepeke,

  more fully in Chapter VI.</p>

  <i>Psammites</i>, or <i>De harenae numero</i> as it is called in the 1544

  Syracusan proposes to show to the king "by geometric proofs which you can
  follow, that the numbers which have been named by us ... are sufficient
  to exceed not only the number of a sand-heap as large as the whole earth,
  but one as large as the universe." For a list of early editions of this

  of the word <i><span class="special"

  the flimsiest authority. Ch. de Paravey, <i>Essai sur l'origine unique et

  <p><a name="Nt_117" href="#NtA_117">[117]</a> The Greeks, probably
  following the Semitic custom, used nine letters of the alphabet for the
  numerals from 1 to 9, then nine others for 10 to 90, and further letters
  to represent 100 to 900. As the ordinary Greek alphabet was insufficient,
  containing only twenty-four letters, an alphabet of twenty-seven letters
  was used.</p>

  <p>I. Weidler, <i>Spicilegium observationum ad historiam notarum
  numeralium</i>, Wittenberg, 1755, derives them from the Hebrew letters;
  Dom Augustin Calmet, "Recherches sur l'origine des chiffres
  d'arithmétique," <i>Mémoires pour l'histoire des sciences et des beaux
  arts</i>, Trévoux, 1707 (pp. 1620-1635, with two plates), derives the
  current symbols from the Romans, stating that they are relics of the
  ancient "Notae Tironianae." These "notes" were part of a system of
  shorthand invented, or at least perfected, by Tiro, a slave who was freed
  by Cicero. L. A. Sedillot, "Sur l'origine de nos chiffres," <i>Atti dell'
  Accademia pontificia dei nuovi Lincei</i>, Vol. XVIII, 1864-1865, pp.
  316-322, derives the Arabic forms from the Roman numerals.</p>

  Trenchant (Lyons, 1566, 1578 ed., p. 12) also says: "La derniere qui
  s'apele nulle, ou zero;" but Champenois, his contemporary, writing in
  Paris in 1577 (although the work was not published until 1578), uses
  "cipher," the Italian influence showing itself less in this center of

  <p><a name="Nt_232" href="#NtA_232">[232]</a> Thus Radulph of Laon (c.

  16, 1843, pp. 1393, 1408) calls attention to the fact that Radulph did
  not know how to use the zero, and he doubts if the sipos was really
  identical with it. Radulph says: "... figuram, cui sipos nomen est <a

  <p><a name="Nt_234" href="#NtA_234">[234]</a> E.g., in the
  twelfth-century <i>Liber aligorismi</i> (see Boncompagni's
  <i>Trattati</i>, II, p. 28). So Ramus (<i>Libri II</i>, 1569 ed., p. 1)
  says: "Circulus quæ nota est ultima: nil per se significat." (See also

  <p><a name="Nt_236" href="#NtA_236">[236]</a> I.e. "circular figure," our
  word <i>notation</i> having come from the medieval <i>nota</i>. Thus
  Tzwivel (1507, f. 2) says: "Nota autem circularis .o. per se sumpta nihil
  vsus habet. alijs tamen adiuncta earum significantiam et auget et ordinem
  permutat quantum quo ponit ordinem. vt adiuncta note binarij hoc modo 20
  facit eam significare bis decem etc." Also (ibid., f. 4), "figura
  circularis," "circularis nota." Clichtoveus (1503 ed., f. <span
  class="scac">XXXVII</span>) calls it "nota aut circularis o," "circularis
  nota," and "figura circularis." Tonstall (1522, f. B_3) says of it:
  "Decimo uero nota ad formam <a href="images/067a.png"><img
  src="images/067a.png" class="middle" style="height:2ex" alt="symbol"
  /></a> litteræ circulari figura est: quam alij circulum, uulgus cyphram
  uocat," and later (f. C_4) speaks of the "circulos." Grammateus, in his
  <i>Algorismus de integris</i> (Erfurt, 1523, f. A_2), speaking of the
  nine significant figures, remarks: "His autem superadditur decima figura
  circularis ut 0 existens que ratione sua nihil significat." Noviomagus
  (<i>De Numeris libri II</i>, Paris, 1539, chap. xvi, "De notis numerorum,
  quas zyphras vocant") calls it "circularis nota, quam ex his solam, alij
  sipheram, Georgius Valla zyphram."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_237" href="#NtA_237">[237]</a> Huswirt, as above. Ramus
  (<i>Scholae mathematicae</i>, 1569 ed., p. 112) discusses the name
  interestingly, saying: "Circulum appellamus cum multis, quam alii thecam,
  alii figuram nihili, alii figuram privationis, seu figuram nullam vocant,
  alii ciphram, cùm tamen hodie omnes hæ notæ vulgò ciphræ nominentur,
  &amp; his notis numerare idem sit quod ciphrare." Tartaglia (1592 ed., f.
  9) says: "si chiama da alcuni tecca, da alcuni circolo, da altri cifra,
  da altri zero, &amp; da alcuni altri nulla."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_238" href="#NtA_238">[238]</a> "Quare autem aliis
  nominibus vocetur, non dicit auctor, quia omnia alia nomina habent
  rationem suae lineationis sive figurationis. Quia rotunda est, dicitur
  haec figura teca ad similitudinem tecae. Teca enim est ferrum figurae
  rotundae, quod ignitum solet in quibusdam regionibus imprimi fronti vel
  maxillae furis seu latronum." [Loc. cit., p. 26.] But in Greek
  <i>theca</i> (<a href="images/067b.png"><img src="images/067b.png"
  class="middle" style="height:2ex" alt="THEKE" /></a>, <span title="thêkê" class="grk"
  >&theta;&#x1F75;&kappa;&eta;</span>) is a place to put something, a
  receptacle. If a vacant column, e.g. in the abacus, was so called, the
  initial might have given the early forms <a href="images/067c.png"><img

  "La prima, che è o, si chiama nulla, ouero zero, ouero niente." It also
  found its way into the Dutch arithmetics, e.g. Raets (1576, 1580 ed., f.
  A_3): "Nullo dat ist niet;" Van der Schuere (1600, 1624 ed., f. 7);
  Wilkens (1669 ed., p. 1). In Germany Johann Albert (Wittenberg, 1534) and

  <p><a name="Nt_273" href="#NtA_273">[273]</a> There is an extensive
  literature on this "Boethius-Frage." The reader who cares to go fully
  into it should consult the various volumes of the <i>Jahrbuch über die
  Fortschritte der Mathematik</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_274" href="#NtA_274">[274]</a> This title was first
  applied to Roman emperors in posthumous coins of Julius Cæsar.
  Subsequently the emperors assumed it during their own lifetimes, thus
  deifying themselves. See F. Gnecchi, <i>Monete romane</i>, 2d ed., Milan,
  1900, p. 299.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_275" href="#NtA_275">[275]</a> This is the common spelling
  of the name, although the more correct Latin form is Boëtius. See
  Harper's <i>Dict. of Class. Lit. and Antiq.</i>, New York, 1897, Vol. I,
  p. 213. There is much uncertainty as to his life. A good summary of the
  evidence is given in the last two editions of the <i>Encyclopædia
  Britannica</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_276" href="#NtA_276">[276]</a> His father, Flavius Manlius
  Boethius, was consul in 487.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_277" href="#NtA_277">[277]</a> There is, however, no good
  historic evidence of this sojourn in Athens.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_278" href="#NtA_278">[278]</a> His arithmetic is dedicated
  to Symmachus: "Domino suo patricio Symmacho Boetius." [Friedlein ed., p.
  3.]</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_279" href="#NtA_279">[279]</a> It was while here that he
  wrote <i>De consolatione philosophiae</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_280" href="#NtA_280">[280]</a> It is sometimes given as
  525.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_281" href="#NtA_281">[281]</a> There was a medieval
  tradition that he was executed because of a work on the Trinity.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_282" href="#NtA_282">[282]</a> Hence the <i>Divus</i> in
  his name.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_283" href="#NtA_283">[283]</a> Thus Dante, speaking of his
  burial place in the monastery of St. Pietro in Ciel d'Oro, at Pavia,
  says:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i4">"The saintly soul, that shows</p>
      <p>The world's deceitfulness, to all who hear him,</p>
      <p>Is, with the sight of all the good that is,</p>
      <p>Blest there. The limbs, whence it was driven, lie</p>
      <p>Down in Cieldauro; and from martyrdom</p>
      <p>And exile came it here."&mdash;<i>Paradiso</i>, Canto X.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p><a name="Nt_284" href="#NtA_284">[284]</a> Not, however, in the
  mercantile schools. The arithmetic of Boethius would have been about the
  last book to be thought of in such institutions. While referred to by
  Bæda (672-735) and Hrabanus Maurus (c. 776-856), it was only after
  Gerbert's time that the <i>Boëtii de institutione arithmetica libri
  duo</i> was really a common work.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_285" href="#NtA_285">[285]</a> Also spelled
  Cassiodorius.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_286" href="#NtA_286">[286]</a> As a matter of fact,
  Boethius could not have translated any work by Pythagoras on music,
  because there was no such work, but he did make the theories of the
  Pythagoreans known. Neither did he translate Nicomachus, although he
  embodied many of the ideas of the Greek writer in his own arithmetic.
  Gibbon follows Cassiodorus in these statements in his <i>Decline and Fall
  of the Roman Empire</i>, chap. xxxix. Martin pointed out with
  positiveness the similarity of the first book of Boethius to the first
  five books of Nicomachus. [<i>Les signes numéraux</i> etc., reprint, p.
  4.]</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_287" href="#NtA_287">[287]</a> The general idea goes back
  to Pythagoras, however.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_288" href="#NtA_288">[288]</a> J. C. Scaliger in his
  <i>Poëtice</i> also said of him: "Boethii Severini ingenium, eruditio,
  ars, sapientia facile provocat omnes auctores, sive illi Graeci sint,
  sive Latini" [Heilbronner, <i>Hist. math. univ.</i>, p. 387]. Libri,
  speaking of the time of Boethius, remarks: "Nous voyons du temps de
  Théodoric, les lettres reprendre une nouvelle vie en Italie, les écoles
  florissantes et les savans honorés. Et certes les ouvrages de Boëce, de
  Cassiodore, de Symmaque, surpassent de beaucoup toutes les productions du
  siècle précédent." [<i>Histoire des mathématiques</i>, Vol. I, p.

  (1491), for example, represents Pythagoras with these numerals before
  him. [Smith, <i>Rara Arithmetica</i>, p. 46.] Isaacus Vossius,
  <i>Observationes ad Pomponium Melam de situ orbis</i>, 1658, maintained
  that the Arabs derived these numerals from the west. A learned
  dissertation to this effect, but deriving them from the Romans instead of
  the Greeks, was written by Ginanni in 1753 (<i>Dissertatio mathematica
  critica de numeralium notarum minuscularum origine</i>, Venice, 1753).
  See also Mannert, <i>De numerorum quos arabicos vocant vera origine
  Pythagorica</i>, Nürnberg, 1801. Even as late as 1827 Romagnosi (in his
  supplement to <i>Ricerche storiche sull' India</i> etc., by Robertson,
  Vol. II, p. 580, 1827) asserted that Pythagoras originated them. [R.
  Bombelli, <i>L'antica numerazione italica</i>, Rome, 1876, p. 59.] Gow
  (<i>Hist. of Greek Math.</i>, p. 98) thinks that Iamblichus must have
  known a similar system in order to have worked out certain of his
  theorems, but this is an unwarranted deduction from the passage
  given.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_335" href="#NtA_335">[335]</a> The best edition of these
  works is that of G. Friedlein, <i>Anicii Manlii Torquati Severini Boetii

  class="scac">MDCCCLXVII</span>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_336" href="#NtA_336">[336]</a> See also P. Tannery, "Notes
  sur la pseudo-géometrie de Boèce," in <i>Bibliotheca Mathematica</i>,
  Vol. I (3), p. 39. This is not the geometry in two books in which are
  mentioned the numerals. There is a manuscript of this pseudo-geometry of
  the ninth century, but the earliest one of the other work is of the
  eleventh century (Tannery), unless the Vatican codex is of the tenth
  century as Friedlein (p. 372) asserts.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_337" href="#NtA_337">[337]</a> Friedlein feels that it is
  partly spurious, but he says: "Eorum librorum, quos Boetius de geometria
  scripsisse dicitur, investigare veram inscriptionem nihil aliud esset
  nisi operam et tempus perdere." [Preface, p. v.] N. Bubnov in the Russian
  <i>Journal of the Ministry of Public Instruction</i>, 1907, in an article
  of which a synopsis is given in the <i>Jahrbuch über die Fortschritte der
  Mathematik</i> for 1907, asserts that the geometry was written in the
  eleventh century.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_338" href="#NtA_338">[338]</a> The most noteworthy of
  these was for a long time Cantor (<i>Geschichte</i>, Vol. I., 3d ed., pp.
  587-588), who in his earlier days even believed that Pythagoras had known
  them. Cantor says (<i>Die römischen Agrimensoren</i>, Leipzig, 1875, p.
  130): "Uns also, wir wiederholen es, ist die Geometrie des Boetius echt,
  dieselbe Schrift, welche er nach Euklid bearbeitete, von welcher ein
  Codex bereits in Jahre 821 im  Kloster Reichenau vorhanden war, von
  welcher ein anderes Exemplar im Jahre 982 zu Mantua in die Hände
  Gerbert's gelangte, von welcher mannigfache Handschriften noch heute
  vorhanden sind." But against this opinion of the antiquity of MSS.
  containing these numerals is the important statement of P. Tannery,
  perhaps the most critical of modern historians of mathematics, that none
  exists earlier than the eleventh century. See also J. L. Heiberg in
  <i>Philologus, Zeitschrift f. d. klass. Altertum</i>, Vol. XLIII, p.
  508.</p>

  <p>Of Cantor's predecessors, Th. H. Martin was one of the most prominent,
  his argument for authenticity appearing in the <i>Revue Archéologique</i>
  for 1856-1857, and in his treatise <i>Les signes numéraux</i> etc. See
  also M. Chasles, "De la connaissance qu'ont eu les anciens d'une
  numération décimale écrite qui fait usage de neuf chiffres prenant les
  valeurs de position," <i>Comptes rendus</i>, Vol. VI, pp. 678-680; "Sur
  l'origine de notre système de numération," <i>Comptes rendus</i>, Vol.
  VIII, pp. 72-81; and note "Sur le passage du premier livre de la
  géométrie de Boèce, relatif à un nouveau système de numération," in his
  work <i>Aperçu historique sur l'origine et le devéloppement des méthodes
  en géométrie</i>, of which the first edition appeared in 1837.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_341" href="#NtA_341">[341]</a> In a Plimpton manuscript of
  the arithmetic of Boethius of the thirteenth century, for example, the
  Roman numerals are all replaced by the Arabic, and the same is true in
  the first printed edition of the book. (See Smith's <i>Rara
  Arithmetica</i>, pp. 434, 25-27.) D. E. Smith also copied from a
  manuscript of the arithmetic in the Laurentian library at Florence, of
  1370, the following forms, <a href="images/092a.png"><img
  src="images/092a.png" class="middle" style="height:2.5ex" alt="Forged
  numerals" /></a> which, of course, are interpolations. An interesting
  example of a forgery in ecclesiastical matters is in the charter said to
  have been given by St. Patrick, granting indulgences to the benefactors
  of Glastonbury, dated "In nomine domini nostri Jhesu Christi Ego
  Patricius humilis servunculus Dei anno incarnationis ejusdem ccccxxx."
  Now if the Benedictines are right in saying that Dionysius Exiguus, a
  Scythian monk, first arranged the Christian chronology c. 532 <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span>, this can hardly be other than spurious. See
  Arbuthnot, loc. cit., p. 38.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_342" href="#NtA_342">[342]</a> Halliwell, in his <i>Rara
  Mathematica, </i>p. 107, states that the disputed passage is not in a
  manuscript belonging to Mr. Ames, nor in one at Trinity College. See also
  Woepcke, in <i>Propagation</i>, pp. 37 and 42. It was the evident
  corruption of the texts in such editions of Boethius as those of Venice,
  1499, Basel, 1546 and 1570, that led Woepcke to publish his work <i>Sur
  l'introduction de l'arithmétique indienne en Occident</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_343" href="#NtA_343">[343]</a> They are found in none of
  the very ancient manuscripts, as, for example, in the ninth-century (?)
  codex in the Laurentian library which one of the authors has examined. It
  should be said, however, that the disputed passage was written after the
  arithmetic, for it contains a reference to that work. See the Friedlein
  ed., p. 397.</p>

  this he describes "quandam formulam, quam ob honorem sui praeceptoris
  mensam Pythagoream nominabant ... a posterioribus appellabatur abacus."
  This, as pictured in the text, is the common Gerbert abacus. In the
  edition in Migne's <i>Patrologia Latina</i>, Vol. LXIII, an ordinary
  multiplication table (sometimes called Pythagorean abacus) is given in
  the illustration.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_434" href="#NtA_434">[434]</a> N. Bubnov, <i>Gerberti
  postea Silvestri II papae opera mathematica</i>, Berlin, 1899, is the
  most complete and reliable source of information; Picavet, loc. cit.,
  <i>Gerbert</i> etc.; Olleris, <i>&OElig;uvres de Gerbert</i>, Paris,
  1867; Havet, <i>Lettres de Gerbert</i>, Paris, 1889 ; H. Weissenborn,
  <i>Gerbert; Beiträge zur Kenntnis der Mathematik des Mittelalters</i>,
  Berlin, 1888, and <i>Zur Geschichte der Einführung der jetzigen Ziffern
  in Europa durch Gerbert</i>, Berlin, 1892; Büdinger, <i>Ueber Gerberts
  wissenschaftliche und politische Stellung</i>, Cassel, 1851; Richer,
  "Historiarum liber III," in Bubnov, loc. cit., pp. 376-381; Nagl,
  <i>Gerbert und die Rechenkunst des 10. Jahrhunderts</i>, Vienna,
  1888.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_435" href="#NtA_435">[435]</a> Richer tells of the visit
  to Aurillac by Borel, a Spanish nobleman, just as Gerbert was entering
  into young manhood. He relates how affectionately the abbot received him,
  asking if there were men in Spain well versed in the arts. Upon Borel's
  reply in the affirmative, the abbot asked that one of his young men might
  accompany him upon his return, that he might carry on his studies
  there.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_436" href="#NtA_436">[436]</a> Vicus Ausona. Hatto also
  appears as Atton and Hatton.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_437" href="#NtA_437">[437]</a> This is all that we know of
  his sojourn in Spain, and this comes from his pupil Richer. The stories
  told by Adhemar of Chabanois, an apparently ignorant and certainly
  untrustworthy contemporary, of his going to Cordova, are unsupported.
  (See e.g. Picavet, p. 34.) Nevertheless this testimony is still accepted:
  K. von Raumer, for example (<i>Geschichte der Pädagogik</i>, 6th ed.,
  1890, Vol. I, p. 6), says "Mathematik studierte man im Mittelalter bei
  den Arabern in Spanien. Zu ihnen gieng Gerbert, nachmaliger Pabst
  Sylvester II."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_438" href="#NtA_438">[438]</a> Thus in a letter to
  Aldaberon he says: "Quos post repperimus speretis, id est VIII volumina
  Boeti de astrologia, praeclarissima quoque figurarum geometriæ, aliaque
  non minus admiranda" (Epist. 8). Also in a letter to Rainard (Epist.
  130), he says: "Ex tuis sumptibus fac ut michi scribantur M. Manlius
  (Manilius in one MS.) de astrologia."</p>

  <i>L'antica numerazione Italica</i>, Rome, 1876, p. 41 n.]</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_444" href="#NtA_444">[444]</a> He writes from Rheims in
  984 to one Lupitus, in Barcelona, saying: "Itaque librum de astrologia
  translatum a te michi petenti dirige," presumably referring to some
  Arabic treatise. [Epist. no. 24 of the Havet collection, p. 19.]</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_447" href="#NtA_447">[447]</a> Woepcke found this in a
  Paris MS. of Radulph of Laon, c. 1100. [<i>Propagation</i>, p. 246.] "Et
  prima quidem trium spaciorum superductio unitatis caractere inscribitur,
  qui chaldeo nomine dicitur igin." See also Alfred Nagl, "Der

  <p><a name="Nt_448" href="#NtA_448">[448]</a> Weissenborn, loc. cit., p.
  239. When Olleris (<i>&OElig;uvres de Gerbert</i>, Paris, 1867, p. cci)
  says, "C'est à lui et non point aux Arabes, que l'Europe doit son système
  et ses signes de numération," he exaggerates, since the evidence is all
  against his knowing the place value. Friedlein emphasizes this in the
  <i>Zeitschrift für Mathematik und Physik</i>, Vol. XII (1867),
  <i>Literaturzeitung</i>, p. 70: "Für das <i>System</i> unserer Numeration
  ist die <i>Null</i> das wesentlichste Merkmal, und diese kannte Gerbert
  nicht. Er selbst schrieb alle Zahlen mit den römischen Zahlzeichen und
  man kann ihm also nicht verdanken, was er selbst nicht kannte."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_449" href="#NtA_449">[449]</a> E.g., Chasles, Büdinger,
  Gerhardt, and Richer. So Martin (<i>Recherches nouvelles</i> etc.)
  believes that Gerbert received them from Boethius or his followers. See
  Woepcke, <i>Propagation</i>, p. 41.</p>

  <i>Gerbert</i>, pp. 2, 6, 168, and Picavet, p. 81. Hock, Cantor, and Th.

  <p><a name="Nt_469" href="#NtA_469">[469]</a> Thus Tzwivel's arithmetic

  <p><a name="Nt_470" href="#NtA_470">[470]</a> Weissenborn uses
  <i>sipos</i> for 0. It is not given by Bernelinus, and appears in Radulph

  <p>In Friedlein's <i>Boetius</i>, p. 396, the plate shows that all of the
  six important manuscripts from which the illustrations are taken contain
  the symbol, while four out of five which give the words use the word
  <i>sipos</i> for 0. The names appear in a twelfth-century anonymous
  manuscript in the Vatican, in a passage beginning</p>

  <p>[Boncompagni <i>Buttetino</i>, XV, p. 132.] Turchill (twelfth century)
  gives the names Igin, andras, hormis, arbas, quimas, caletis, zenis,
  temenias, celentis, saying: "Has autem figuras, ut donnus [dominus]
  Gvillelmus Rx testatur, a pytagoricis habemus, nomina uero ab arabibus."
  (Who the William R. was is not known. Boncompagni <i>Bulletino</i> XV, p.
  136.) Radulph of Laon (d. 1131) asserted that they were Chaldean
  (<i>Propagation</i>, p. 48 n.). A discussion of the whole question is
  also given in E. C. Bayley, loc. cit. Huet, writing in 1679, asserted
  that they were of Semitic origin, as did Nesselmann in spite of his
  despair over ormis, calctis, and celentis; see Woepcke,
  <i>Propagation</i>, p. 48. The names were used as late as the fifteenth
  century, without the zero, but with the superscript dot for 10's, two
  dots for 100's, etc., as among the early Arabs. Gerhardt mentions having
  seen a fourteenth or fifteenth century manuscript in the Bibliotheca
  Amploniana with the names "Ingnin, andras, armis, arbas, quinas, calctis,
  zencis, zemenias, zcelentis," and the statement "Si unum punctum super
  ingnin ponitur, X significat.... Si duo puncta super ... figuras
  superponunter, fiet decuplim illius quod cum uno puncto significabatur,"

  Numeris Libri II</i>, cap. vi.] Gemma Frisius also uses <i>elementa</i>
  and Cardan uses <i>literae</i>. In the first arithmetic by an American
  (Greenwood, 1729) the author speaks of "a few Arabian <i>Charecters</i>
  or Numeral Figures, called <i>Digits</i>" (p. 1), and as late as 1790, in
  the third edition of J. J. Blassière's arithmetic (1st ed. 1769), the
  name <i>characters</i> is still in use, both for "de Latynsche en de
  Arabische" (p. 4), as is also the term "Cyfferletters" (p. 6, n.).
  <i>Ziffer</i>, the modern German form of cipher, was commonly used to
  designate any of the nine figures, as by Boeschenstein and Riese,
  although others, like Köbel, used it only for the zero. So <i>zifre</i>
  appears in the arithmetic by Borgo, 1550 ed. In a Munich codex of the
  twelfth century, attributed to Gerland, they are called <i>characters</i>
  only: "Usque ad VIIII. enim porrigitur omnis numerus et qui supercrescit
  eisdem designator Karacteribus." [Boncompagni <i>Bulletino</i>, Vol. X.

  <p><a name="Nt_545" href="#NtA_545">[545]</a> Curtze, loc. cit., found
  some forty-five copies of the <i>Algorismus</i> in three libraries of
  Munich, Venice, and Erfurt (Amploniana). Examination of two manuscripts
  from the Plimpton collection and the Columbia library shows such marked
  divergence from each other and from the text published by Curtze that the
  conclusion seems legitimate that these were students' lecture notes. The
  shorthand character of the writing further confirms this view, as it
  shows that they were written largely for the personal use of the
  writers.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_555" href="#NtA_555">[555]</a> An illustration of this
  feeling is seen in the writings of Prosdocimo de' Beldomandi (b. c.
  1370-1380, d. 1428): "Inveni in quam pluribus libris algorismi nuncupatis
  mores circa numeros operandi satis varios atque diversos, qui licet boni
  existerent atque veri erant, tamen fastidiosi, tum propter ipsarum
  regularum multitudinem, tum propter earum deleationes, tum etiam propter
  ipsarum operationum probationes, utrum si bone fuerint vel ne. Erant et
  etiam isti modi interim fastidiosi, quod si in aliquo calculo astroloico
  error contigisset, calculatorem operationem suam a capite incipere
  oportebat, dato quod error suus adhuc satis propinquus existeret; et hoc
  propter figuras in sua operatione deletas. Indigebat etiam calculator
  semper aliquo lapide vel sibi conformi, super quo scribere atque
  faciliter delere posset figuras cum quibus operabatur in calculo suo. Et
  quia haec omnia satis fastidiosa atque laboriosa mihi visa sunt, disposui
  libellum edere in quo omnia ista abicerentur: qui etiam algorismus sive
  liber de numeris denominari poterit. Scias tamen quod in hoc libello
  ponere non intendo nisi ea quae ad calculum necessaria sunt, alia quae in
  aliis libris practice arismetrice tanguntur, ad calculum non necessaria,
  propter brevitatem dimitendo." [Quoted by A. Nagl, <i>Zeitschrift für

  the Treviso arithmetic (1478), Clichtoveus (c. 1507 ed., where both i and
  j are so used), Chiarini (1481), Sacrobosco (1488 ed.), and Tzwivel (1507
  ed., where jj and jz are used for 11 and 12). This was not universal,
  however, for the <i>Algorithmus linealis</i> of c. 1488 has a special
  type for 1. In a student's notebook of lectures taken at the University
  of Würzburg in 1660, in Mr. Plimpton's library, the ones are all in the

  without mention of dates.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_598" href="#NtA_598">[598]</a> The first is from the
